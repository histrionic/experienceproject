 <p><b><i>
      Can a person with hpd live a normal life?</b>
      <br>
<br>
    Absolutely! If fact, their incredible social skills and desire to people please usually makes them find fulfillment professionally. Their Achilles heel LIES in the relationship department. Without treatment and self-awareness they struggle to have the skillset to deal with their feelings. As a result they will continue using maladaptive behaviors that are intolerable in interpersonal relationships with others, romantically and otherwise. The key is for them to find a way to improve and manage their emotional reactions and expectations. This is not easy, but it is achievable with enough self-discipline.</i>

      Do all people with histrionic personality lack empathy?</b>
      <br>
<br>
     People with histrionic personality are very capable of showing care and concern for other people, as long as the situation isn't related to themselves. It is even common for these people to demonstrate more empathy than the people around them when looking at situations they were not directly (or negatively) involved with. This happens all the time when they are at work or around people they only see on a superficial level. Then these same people will seem like they are completely lacking empathy to those who they are in a close relationship them. This is because their constant attention-seeking behavior makes it extremely difficult for them to see the bigger picture in a relationship. Unless they become self aware they will find it almost impossible to see someone else's viewpoint with any negative issues that are directly related to their behavior.

    <p><b><i>
      Do people with histrionic personality have a high self-esteem?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      No. Although people with hpd may appear to have high self-esteem this idea is incorrect. The loud dress and clothing, exaggerated speech and other attention seeking behaviors look like complete confidence. On the contrary, their self-esteem and self-worth is often based on how others view them and not how they view themselves. A person with histrionic personality will frequently rely on praise or interests of others to build up self-worth. Because of this, they may get influenced by outside suggestions.</i>

      Is it common for a person with histrionic or borderline personality to have multiple active romantic partners at the same time?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Is it common for someone with BPD to have multiple active romantic partners at the same time?

Yes this is a very common trait among BDP sufferers for a few different reasons.

Bored: After a while after all of the romantic endorphins have worn off they will become bored of you. The thrill they seek is the chase and NOT the capture. They want you because they can’t have you but once they have you you are seen as boring and predictable. If you keep the chase going by not responding to them, not reassuring that you love them constantly, setting boundaries and not falling for their every whim then they will be after you like a fly on rice.
The Void: Histrionics and Borderlines will do anything to try to fill the endless black void that lingers inside of them. They will loose the ability to feel anything and will try anything to feel again and that can result in multiple affairs, sexting, drugs, cutting etc.
Black and White Thinking: Non-disordered people understand that people are complex creatures made up of good and bad qualities and we are able to understand that if someone has done something to make us upset it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are a bad person. They may have had a bad day but that doesn’t define who they are underneath. Borderlines and histrionics often lack the capacity to see people this way. You are either all good or all bad depending on what you are doing or how you are making them feel at any given moment. This can fluctuate day to day or hour by hour. Once you are seen as bad all of your good qualities are lost in their minds. They will cheat to make you pay for your wrong doings and how badly you have made them feel.
Fear of Abandonment: This you will not be able to wrap your head around but they will cheat because they are afraid that you will leave them. They may feel some tension in your relationship and will automatically jump to the conclusion that you are ready to cut ties with them. Cheating then becomes their self-fulfilling prophecy and when you find out and their true fears are realized confirming their internal belief that everyone leaves them in the end.
Testing Limits/ Love: They want to see how much you REALLY love them. Will you accept cheating, yelling, excessive spending, threats, false promises? They are testing you constantly to see how much they can get away with before you will leave them for good. The longer you stay the more they will push your boundaries. This is NOT love its addiction and obsession.

    <p><b><i>
      Can you trust someone with histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Very interesting question for sure. I will just give my take from what I experienced in my marriage. Fully trust? No.

The big issue that I see is that in many cases (not all), a person with hpd will tell their truth. Not the complete truth or even straight truth for that matter.

I believe that it all depends on stress levels going on inside of that person on what you might see. I personally was lied to for many years. That being said she didn't lie about everything.

I was constantly confused with all of the lies and gaslighting. But looking back on it, most things were not very true.

Throughout my marriage I was led to believe that I was the sensitive one. Nope that was just my nervous system in high gear from ptsd.

      Why do a lot of perverted men gravitate towards women who have borderline and/or histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Your question has more to do with the pwBPD/HPD than these men.

Those with BPD and HPD tend to be rather impulsive sexually. They’re likely to get themselves into situations or behave in a way that attracts these men or women. One thing you’ll hear from people that have dated a pwBPD/HPD is how sexual the pwBPD/HPD was so fast in the relationship. The lack of boundaries in a pwBPD/HPD also makes them much more likely to talk about inappropriate topics with complete strangers (including perverts). Many people with BPD and HPD tend to dress provocatively as a way to gain external attention and validation as well.

      What is it like to feel no core identity? What mental disorders have this as a central symptom?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Histrionic Personality Disorder

It is most often associated with dramatic, sexual, provocative behaviours but the underlying cause and feelings are overlooked and misinterpreted.

The reason histrionics have such dramatic and theatrical behaviour, is that they have no core identity.

This picture represents how a histrionic may feel and act. The girl literally becomes her environment, she becomes what surrounds her or what people mirror back to her. She encompasses it.

For histrionics, having no core identity can be severely scary, but we soften over it with theatrical displays and manipulative behaviour. We become what surrounds us, and mirror those that we talk to or interact with, so that we ‘become them’. We are not ourselves, we are whomever we are with. If they are gone, then we are not here, as we were them. They are us.

The most horrific situation for a histrionic, is to be completely and utterly alone. Having no one to mirror, or watch us is hell, as we feel like we are not really here. No one sees us so how could we even be here? So we act out, we become manipulative and scheming and dramatic and whatever you need us to be to get the attention and assurance that we need to feel real, to feel alive, to feel like we are someone.

I think Histrionics get somewhat of a bad reputation as being these girls (or guys) that are overly dramatic, play the victim all the time and act sexually, but the underlying cause can be sometimes extremely sad. It can arise from extreme neglect and abuse in childhood. Think about it, a child so neglected or abused the only way that he or she gets attention, she figures out, is to act sexually, act provocatively, act overly emotional. No child should have to do this to get the attention and love that she so deserves.

So if you feel this is you, feed yourself. Be dramatic, be theatrical, wear that outfit, put on a that makeup. You deserve it, you need it. No one who is not histrionic would understand. They have their needs, we have ours, ours may be slightly different and they may not understand it, but we do what we have to do survive.

Don’t hate us. All we want is what we never got.

      Is the freshmen girl who is flirty, attention seeking, and promiscuous with senior boys in high school likely a sufferer from histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Yes, maybe the quiet type aka high functioning. These girls are usually successful with academics, sports, etc. but have a history of sexual abuse. They think they are defective so they use a lot of boys giving them attention or affection as validation that they are still worthy.

<p><b><i>
      Do all HPD people cheat on their partners or there might be exceptions?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      I will not say all… but most probably yes!

They are people pleasers. They would do many things (immoral) just to please someone… get in good graces, to be liked.

I believe (my personal opinion) that any HPD can be manipulated to cheat! If they come across a person who understands their disorder and knows how to push the right buttons - they will submit!

In any case, not healthy to live with someone that you would never know if they are sucking co*k on the side.

PS. If you ask pwHPD if they cheat - answer will be definitely no. What a surprise. But reading lots of posts from ppl that fell victim to them… very easy to see pattern. And come to certain conclusion.

<p><b><i>
      Are girls who start showing early signs of borderline and/or histrionic personality disorder commonly targeted for sexual abuse/harassment?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Speaking from personal experience (and sadly, also my ex’s, and a couple of other ladies), there are certainly a number of factors which leave women with BPD/HPD at higher risk than average for being targeted for repeated sexual abuse/harassment. Excluding early childhood abuse which may have caused the personality disorder to develop in the first place —

BORDERLINE

Have trouble setting and enforcing personal boundaries, as well as respecting others’. Chronic people pleasers. Often social, friendly, flirtacious, approachable, quick to smile. Difficulty saying no.
Prone to retraumatization, seeking to be in and control relationships, which they associate with their childhoods but had no control, drawn to abusive partners, who also don’t respect others’ boundaries. Confuses sexual attention with emotional/romantic intimacy.
Dissociation is common under stress — sex may trigger dissociation. Dissociation may result in a total blackout period where the pwBPD has no awareness or recollection of what’s going on. There are even cases of dissociation causing uncharacteristic promiscuous behavior — during which the woman uncharacteristically flirts with inappropriate partners and consents to sexual acts they wouldn’t have in another state. This is actually a form of self-defense triggered by emotional conflict. She will not remember or understand later on. (Also sadly something I witnessed more than once with my ex.)
Less likely to be believed by authorities or loved ones if they report a sex crime — this may also be their personal perception based on past experience, which will lead to them not reporting the crime. May have been deemed untrustworthy or manipulative in the past. The girl who cried wolf. She represses the trauma, avoiding feelings of shame and guilt, believing that she is at fault and deserves what happened to her. This reinforces her core belief that she is worthless and unlovable.
Black-and-white thinking patterns cause them to see their abusers as “all good” or “all bad.” Meaning an abuser can manipulate his target into seeing him as “all good” again, invalidating her emotions of being taken advantage of, causing her to forgive his abusive behavior, and permit it to happen again.
Impairment or intoxication. BPD is associated with high levels of substance abuse. Someone who is impaired will be more vulnerable and likely to be targeted.
HISTRIONIC

Attention-seeking appearance, overly sexualized attire and presentation, craves attention and wants to be noticed. This will often get her the wrong kind of attention, but it’s what she’s used to, so she’ll normalize it.
She will be accused of “asking for it” or “wanting it.” No one will believe her when she says it was rape.
Overlaps with BPD in the areas of impulsivity/risky decision-making, substance abuse, increasing vulnerability.
The grim reality is that many women with BPD/HPD will have sexual experiences which they feel ambiguous about, because they aren’t able to identify whether or not they consented to it or whether or not the attention was even desired. They may think they’re interested at one point, craving affection or attention, then change their minds because the man wants to do something they aren’t comfortable with, and be unable to say no until it’s too late. Because they didn’t say no, they’ll rewrite the incident in their minds as something that was irresponsible and risky, but desired. This alleviates the need to blame someone outside herself. The man will argue that she was consenting and willing, because she didn’t say no or fight back.

Women who display this kind of behavior are more likely to be blamed or shamed than validated and understood. This is the fear that keeps women from coming forward to blame their abuser. It’s important to always be gentle and believe any woman who is reporting a sex crime.

      Why do people with histrionic personality disorder need excessive attention?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Excessive need for attention is common in most Cluster B disorders; Histrionic Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. The exception being Antisocial Personality Disorder. The reason in BPD and NPD is a subconscious need for validation. It’s the same for HPD. They need to know they exist, that they matter, they’re important, they’re needed or wanted (this is particularly true with seductive or sexual attention seeking), someone is thinking about them, or they’re being talked about. Hence why you see “dramatic” behaviors in these personality disorders as well. They don’t typically care if the attention is negative or positive, obviously positive is preferred but sometimes attention is attention, period.

<p><b><i>
      What is something that almost nobody knows about histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Histrionic is usually visible in plain sight, unlike BorderlinePD, but they can get away with a lot because it appears in many contexts to be just extroverted "confidence".

For partners it might take a while for other background symptoms other then sexualized showing off to become visible. By the time the partner figures it out is it often too late.

Like BPD partners, histrionic partners will fake attachment to partners and depart at the drop of a hat to pursue greener pastures regardless of relationship duration or history.

They would think nothing of departing without any explanation if the time seems right to them. They tend to be working a scheme in the background that they intend the partner not to become aware of.

When you look back, you will recall glimpses of behaviors that were sociopathic. Histrionics in a sense are gaming their partners basically, so they can be quite hurtful or dangerous.

      What are the chances of my marriage surviving? My wife has histrionic personality disorder (HPD).</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Unless you can put up with a lot of double standards, emotionally draining drama, hot/cold, push/pull and none of your needs/desires being important, then your chances are pretty much next to nothing. And the reality of it… you don’t deserve that kind of treatment and you should definitely get a divorce and find a healthy relationship after you do some therapy yourself to no longer be attracted to women like your wife. I’m sorry, I’m guessing that’s not what you wanted to hear. If it helps realize the problem is not with you. It is with her. It might feel like a curse, but it is actually pretty impressive that you were able to marry her in the first place. She found something unique and amazing about you. Most women who are histrionic struggle staying with the same partner at around the six month mark. And that's if the guy doesn't leave after getting fed up with her flirting with other men every opportunity she gets. She might not have figured out her obsession with getting noticed by other men, but she knew keeping you was also a priority. It is like a person who has a favorite food or their home. They might be willing try other things. They might even decided they enjoy them, but nothing beats the pleasure they get when eating their favorite dish. Likewise, vacations and roadtrips can be exciting temporarily, but nothing feels safer and better than being home. You feel like a rock that's been thrown around. Still, you are her rock! Good luck with whatever decision you make!

      Can people with histrionic personality disorder be loyal and feel real love?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      When I was not self aware and not doing therapy and on medication…. No chance in hell. Sorry about your luck! Today is a different story. Currently, I haven’t found a man yet, since my divorce years ago, that I want to stay in a relationship with long enough to commit long term too, and that I’d be willing to work through the low points that would lead me to wander. However, after much work I’m reaching that point where I do feel it will be possible when I’m in the right relationship. At this point in time, Instead of hurting the guy by staying and lying that I love him and/or then cheating, I end the relationship. That’s major growth for me right there.

<p><b><i>
      What should a guy expect when a girl with histrionic personality disorder dumps him suddenly for another guy?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      The next guy is just a source of approval, like you were. HPD’s are mostly incapable of forming close bonds with others and rarely differentiate the importance of one individual to another. If it suits her purpose to call you abusive, she will. It is highly likely this will be the case as this will garner her lots of attention from the next guy.

Withdrawing attention will take a huge blow to her fragile sense of self, probably more than they can handle. She will likely cycle around again to see whether she has a hold over you; if she doesnt, the shape shifting to the person of your dreams starts again. She wants to know you will always be an attention source for her, and will create any persona to attain this from you. Dont be fooled, she will express a strong point of view to you in the morning and the total opposite to the other person she meets that evening. kind of scary to say the least. Who you think she is and who she is will likely be different. Look for lack of consistency in thoughts, actions, behaviour, moral values.

They do not crave deep and intimate relationships, they crave the feelings of infatuation from partners that result in great amounts of attention for them. Your thoughts, needs or feelings rarely show up on their radar. If she comes back and you want your place back, remember your role; deliver attention, approve and indulge her over exaggerated stories and drama. And remember that whatever you do, you cant give enough attention. No one gives as much as someone in the honeymoon phase, so they seek it out over and over again. That is why some partners are able to have a successful relationship with them for any duration before shit hits the fan. They are able to spend lots of time with them. She is able to keep her attention bucket filled by her committed man. The only problem is the bucket has to stay getting filled because it has a hole in the bottom. As soon as the guy gets a different job or something else disrups all of their together time she starts looking for other sources to fill it.

<p><b><i>
      Is a woman with histrionic personality disorder likely to commit violent acts when angry or to express harmless dramatic emotions?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      They like to pair with a person with hidden self-esteem issues that will put up with a lot of push-pull in order to keep his trophy partner. Histrionic is the only disorder tied to physical appearance; they can be attractive or socially confident (confidence is attractive). But they mostly only have to threaten that a relationship is over and the partner will cave in. Sometimes the guy is simply a doormat. Other times it's a good guy waiting for the person he fell in love with to return. 

Violence is sure to occur over one thing though: jealousy. Histrionics cannot abide by being rejected. They are the most important thing and of highest value - they can’t imagine being the one that gets dumped - they dump people, and often, not the other way around. Except for rejection and jealousy, they are not typically violent. They have far better ways to destroy a person and their fragile self worth. They chose a partner who they feel is willing to take on the identity of “I’m her man.” It is enough for them because she will convince him that he is defined by being with her and it gives him status. She is eye candy. He is no one. Actually, all of the friends of the Histrionic are like this too. They are fan clubs and hangers-on.

<p><b><i>
      Do people with histrionic personality disorder use the gaslighting technique to manipulate their partners?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Short answer would be YES! Histrionics most often have one or more (sociopathic-like) schemes running in the background which you are not supposed to notice so gaslighting is a way to deflect attention away from those schemes. Rather like having a partner with two personalities, one lightness and one darkness, the one you are looking at socially everyday lightness with an extroverted smile on her face is only half of what is going on there.

Seeking control and your sole attention the darkness persona is hacking into your cellphone at night (boundary violations typical) when you are sleeping to monitor your activities without ever revealing. The next day she creates lots of drama that has nothing to do with your phone suggesting you are deficient in some way. While you are present in good faith this is what she has her mind on, never revealing any of it to you until the big bang break.

Often they are on the hunt for departure rationale as they simultaneously hunt for better partner options…Somewhat ironically this is what she assumes you are doing. Those two hunting activities are always ongoing continuously….the hunt for demonization fuel and the hunt for better options.

Never really getting attached and faking intimacy, you are just a temporary meal ticket until better options can be found. As soon as they are found all of the hidden investigation of you comes out in the form of demonization as they head out the door, often without a word of explanation, with the relationship house burning to the ground. All positive history is forgotten as it means nothing to them. A nice added gaslighting touch might be accusing you of being incapable of intimacy. Most of what they tell you is upside down.

You having no closure at all is no problem for them as by then they have constructed a rationale that you really deserve whats coming to you. This makes sense to no one except the histrionic who spends a lot of time in her own scheming head rather than being present with you.

Very easy for normal partners to become disoriented in this continuous crazy-making context. Welcome to the histrionics world…very similar in many ways to the BorderlinePD partner experience except that the histrionic partner is much more extroverted and confident that their sexualized approach is the key to success in the world.

These are exhausting and psychologically dangerous folks. All time invested in them is wasted as they are unstable, highly manipulative, impulse driven and never satisfied. No amount of attention can fix this as it is a childhood injury.

      What are the common behaviors of a person with histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Histrionic personality disorder is one of the ten disorders on the personality spectrum in the DSM V.

HPD is a mental health disorder that affects thinking, perceiving and relating to others. It is chronic and may last for years or for a life time. It’s treatable but prognosis may be poor or guarded, and is not curable.

It is one of cluster “B: personality disorders or “dramatic” disorders with attention seeking at its core, intense unstable emotions, and a distorted self image with an excessive need for approval, including inappropriate sexualizing, erotic, manipulative, demanding and erratic behavior. They can also be very charming. They use a form of dress to bring attention to themselves. Etiology is unknown though it is presently thought to be caused by biological, cognitive, developmental and social factors. They are found to have defective neurotransmitter release systems and a malfunction in a group of neurotransmitters called catecholamines. They may disassociate, claiming 2 or more personalities in severe cases and use displacement of anger, shallow and shifting emotions in less severe cases. When the speak, they aim to please and to impress. As you may surmise, diagnosis is complicated because symptoms mimic other disorders. It may take several structured and unstructured interviews before a diagnosis is made. The MMPI -2 and projective drawings may be useful. There is high correlation of co-morbidity with alcoholism, somataform, conversion, and major depressive disorders. It’s fairly easy to mistake for borderline personality disorder, however, less suicidal ideation or attempts mark HPD from BPD.

Long term treatment is indicated, especially psychodynamic therapy. group therapy and cognitive behavior therapy may compliment efforts to decrease dramatization. repression, and other behaviors associate with the illness. They really are the drama queens of the world but the disorder is not limited to females.

<p><b><i>
      Is a woman with histrionic personality disorder likely to commit violent acts when angry or to express harmless dramatic emotions?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      I am not one for violent acts. I don’t start physical fights or destroy property because the response to that is not the kind of attention I thrive off of. Nobody will take your side, or emotionally support you if you’re damaging people/things. Example… when the news reports of violence no one feels sorry for the people doing the destruction to property, they feel awful and want to help the victim. If I’m angry I’m going to manipulate the situation by getting the other person to feel bad about whatever they are doing to me (even if I deserve it). For example, if I’m angry with my SO I’m going to cry, which automatically weakens him…. no man wants to see a woman cry, they are fixers and the gut reaction is to make it all better. Then I’ll emotionally twist the situation and tell him how much I’m hurt and whatever other emotion I’ve discovered, in the time of being with him, that I know will hit him the hardest to make him buckle to my will. Afterwards, I can then go and get more attention from friends by sharing what my SO did to me and how he apologized, (which shows he was wrong not me 😈) and now I have their support that his character is questionable so down the road, when I inevitably leave, everyone agrees I should have and I deserve so much better.

So no, violence is not my thing. I like emotional drama.

disclaimer…. I have been on meds and in therapy for 13 years and rarely do these kinds of actions anymore. I have healthy coping mechanisms and communication skills and am just a better person all around.

      What is the definition and characteristics of Histrionic personality disorder and is it similar to borderline personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Hi! My name’s Vanessa, and I’m here to tell you about an exciting new product from PDs ‘R Us! This five-minute nymphomercial will give you everything you need to know about acquiring your very own Histrionic Adaptation! Doctors and therapists agree, it’s a bitch to treat, but a pleasure to try!

Are you a person with BPD, grappling with existential fears of a lonely and meaningless existence? Do you constantly find yourself engulfed and reliant on a single romantic partner to give you the love and validation you need to hold your emotions together every day? If so, don’t worry. We at PDs ‘R Us have developed a revolutionary adaptation that will give you the validation and attention you crave, without the hassle of human attachment!
<br>
Histrionics is a fast-acting formula that can calm even the worst meltdown in minutes, simply by finding a stranger to cover you with the admiration and praise that you so desperately ̶n̶e̶e̶d̶ ̶ deserve. For best results, adhere to the following ten-step procedure:

Breathe. Remind yourself that you’re a sexy goddess who could get anyone you want, if you wanted to. But you don’t want to. You don’t want to commit like that. Because commitment requires vulnerability, and vulnerability risks pain. Pain is weakness. Weakness is just… so dissatisfying. Who needs a romantic partner who could abandon you at any moment, when you can get love and attention from anyone on the street!
Put together your sexiest outfit. Show some skin. Apply the world’s sexiest makeup; emphasize your best traits. Pick a shade of lipstick that will stand out in a crowd. Create a mask that advertises to the world, “I’m open for anything, and out of your league.”
Realize that you can flirt with anyone. Young, old, gay, straight, blind, ugly, religious… Doesn’t matter who, doesn’t matter where — the tenets of flirting are the same: Be open. Show interest. Smile. Make eye contact. Give him a blowjob with your eyes from across the room. You’re not talking to their conscious mind, you’re reaching deep into their animal brain and flipping the switch that says, “YES!” Laugh at their jokes. Welcome their compliments and positive gestures. Encourage them to listen, but don’t ask them questions. Questions give them the power over the conversation, and the power is in your hands. Keep it. Even if they’re hardwired to not want you, sexually — those poor, deprived straight girls — they’ll still be thrilled to give you attention of some variety.
Talk yourself up. Modesty is an instrument of the modest, and no one pays attention to the modest. Cut that shit out. You’re not a temp at The Gap, you’re a senior sales associate for a major distribution centre. You’re not a student, you’re an aspiring professor in transcultural, comparative literature. You’re not working on a book, you’re weighing offers of publication for your premier, genre-breaking novel. You’re not just someone from the suburbs, you’re an heiress to your father’s flourishing real estate empire, used to exquisitely expensive treatment. You’re not just a girl, you’re a princess, queen, and empress, deserving of unadulterated adoration and generosity. You’re not in a relationship, you’re newly single and looking to party. Because, psst! Here’s a secret! As long as you never form attachments with people, you can tell them absolutely anything, and it becomes true, if only for a night. No repercussions, aside from a complete lack of intimacy and a general reliance on external validation to give you a sense of identity. But who needs those things when you’re drowning in gifts and adoration??
Don’t chase, and don’t work for attention. That gives them the power, too. If someone doesn’t want to give you attention, just avoid that person. You don’t need that kind of negativity in your life.
Speaking of negativity, remember that hatred and resentment is attention. Hate and love occupy the same place in the brain, so if someone refuses to give you adoration, go ahead and seduce their boyfriend. Instant attention. Two birds, one attention-seeking missile.
Realize that all attention is good attention. It doesn’t matter if an action is embarrassing, because no one can look away. It’s okay to make a scene if they don’t have your preferred brand of luxury bottled water. It’s okay to dance naked in front of a bunch of strangers because someone dared you to. It’s okay! Guaranteed attention. Allow strangers to goad you, and they’ll praise your open-mindedness. Or your wildness. Or your curves. Praise is praise, right?
Let that pesky sense of identity evaporate in the heat of others’ expectations. Owning your own identity means getting hurt if others judge you for it. We don’t like weakness, remember? It’s so much easier — and feels so much better — to just be who people want you to be, do what they want you to do, and never have to worry about showing them who you really are. Put that in a box and forget about it (until the inevitable mid-life therapy, of course).
Be open to anything, but never put out. Never reject anyone, and never say no to a proposition — just deflect it down the road. The appearance of not having boundaries will fascinate anyone, as they’ll think they finally found someone as crazy as they are. Their hope in a future will nail them to you like a cross. Hope is your friend. Hope is your wingman. Hope gets you into private parties, puts a drink in your hand, twirls you around the dance floor, and pays for your Uber home. Hope treats you to exotic meals in far away places. Hope buys you flowers, texts you sweet nothings before bed. But when you start having sex, the pressure starts. They want exclusivity. And it’s hard to keep up a detached charade when you’re seeing the same stranger over and over again. Eventually, he might not be a stranger anymore, and when that happens, hope will crumble and you’re right back where you started. Don’t have sex. At all. Period. Unless you really like the guy, in which case, ride that dick like an electric bull, you fabulous she-tiger!
Always keep at least three strangers on the hook, in case the stranger you’ve been seeing gets too close. As any IT professional will tell you, always have a backup. Protects against sudden crashes and viruses.
Women who have switched to histrionics have reported a ten times higher rate of compliments than women who stick to quiet, self-harming adaptations, and are more than fifty times as likely to have pop songs written about them. Those choosing histrionics have also reported a significant boost to their sense of confidence and control, although histrionics may also be associated with an increased risk of harassment and discrimination in the workplace.

Side effects may include shortness of temper, increased sense of grandiosity, weight loss, accusations of infidelity, infidelity, inflated feelings of self-importance, alcoholism, premature workplace termination, living a college lifestyle in your 30s, disappointment from friends and family, reduced trust, regret, and a ‘reputation’.

Ask your therapist if a histrionic adaptation is right for you. Don’t delay, since your friends, family, and partner can all abandon you at any moment. But wait! There’s more! If you upvote in the next 24 hours, you’ll receive a sense of complicit satisfaction absolutely free! Call now to join the thousands of men and women who’ve decided to give up a sense of identity in exchange for unearned adoration. You’ll be happy you did.

      Do women who suffer from histrionic personality disorder and flirt really bad with other men when their partner is away know they are flirting, or in their mind do they just think they are being kind and friendly?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      People with histrionic personality disorder (HBD) only think in terms of attention and admiration so their thinking driven by only these two things

How can they get attention of all people around them?
How can they look better in the eyes of other people?
Now let me address these two things one by one

How they get attention?

People with HPD gets attention by showing extreme emotions. If they get attention easily that's best for them but sometimes they want too much attention for that they exhibit extreme emotions like yelling in public , crying in public loudly, laughing all of sudden in loud voice on things which aren't even funny, walking in sexual provocative way in public and in some cases start stripping in public (they will have a proper reason to justify this).
How they make themselves better in the eyes of others?

Once they will get attention now they will show themselves like really humble and down to earth person and they do this in a subtle way.

And these above two points go together hand in hand

For example let say a girl named Suhani with HPD is in a restaurant. She is sitting on her seat and person just passes by her seat so she will start yelling on that person for some unknown reason (known to her tho). She will yell on this person till everyone start staring her(attention part done).

Now to show herself better in the eyes of other people she will kiss him(on cheeks if she is in relationship)/hug him all of sudden in front of everyone and say oh thankyou I didn't notice in your perspective I really consider Your perspective.(admiration part)

Now comes to your question

it depends on what she wanted in that situation attention or admiration

If she is trying to get attention by flirting then she won't be sure or you can say she doesn't know surely is that she wanted

But if she is trying to get admiration by flirting then she does know what she is doing but she justify her actions by making assumptions in her mind like the one you mentioned to feel being kind and friendly to others.

Thanks for reading ❤️

Hope it helps :)

      Do people with histrionic personality disorder enjoy seeing other people suffer?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      I do not believe that people diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) are intentionally or plotting to hurt others.

They lack self-esteem, suffer from anxiety, and more often than not have a diagnosis of depression.

They are often self-centered and they are constantly seeking attention whether that is in a positive or negative way.

They are seeking love and often do it through seduction and many especially in their young years look for it in a much older person.

They may equate sex with love or think sex can come before love rather than the opposite, so they are emotionally unfulfilled and often they keep seeking out partners who may sexually satisfy them but leave them feeling empty and broken.

They have great difficulty keeping friends and as they get older they often have problems in their professional lives where they quit their job over some perceived slight or they are fired due to their inappropriate behaviour.

A person with (HPD) has little insight into their issues so they have can have a very difficult time understanding what they have done wrong in certain situations.

If you have been hurt by someone with (HPD) or if you have been diagnosed with (HPD) I hope this information is helpful.

      Is someone with histrionic personality disorder just as manipulative and deceptive as someone with narcissistic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      HPD and NPD are two separate disorders although both under the same Cluster B category. Comparing them is like comparing an orange and a tangerine. Same different.

Some people refer to HPD as NPD with sexual flavour. I can see where they are coming from as some of the HPD's symptoms mimic exhibitionist/overt narcissist, but there are distinct differences between them.

PwHPD crave attention just like pwNPD, but pwNPD care about their image and building reputation. PwHPD care more about positive attention but negative attention will do sometimes. Everything about them is loud and can border being inappropriate, from the way they dressed, talk and behave. Even if they are being seen as sluts, they won't care. Some may actually be proud to be viewed that way. PwHPD require not only attention but also praise, admiration and validation that they're good/smart/good looking, etc.

PwHPD are much more moody and emotional to the point of dramatic, that they are easily confused with pwBPD. PwNPD are by far slower with their emotions.

Unlike pwNPD who tend to be dry, vold, detached and mechanically seek to pleasure themselves in bed, pwHPD tend to be very hot and seek to pleasure their sexual partner first in bed. They also tend to romanticise a relationship as more intimate than it is. Any flirtation or sexual advantage will be seen as love by them. Not so with pwNPD.

Do pwHPD manipulate others like pwNPD? Yes, if they need too, for different reasons and in different ways than pwNPD.

      Do histrionic women ever settle down with one partner?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Yes, they will settle down with one partner…. For awhile. Then they get emotionally bored. Because the poor guy can't live up to their expectations. He must be able to make over them 24/7 and drop whatever he is doing for her no matter what. If he can't he's failing. For me, that’s around the six month mark. I’ve already been devaluing/idealizing you for some time but that magic six months seems to be when the mask really begins slip, and I don’t mind it. Now the relationship gets twisted and the real emotional mind fuckery happens and I’m just getting back into my element. Enter Drama Queen Supreme. (Yes, I know, I’m a sick person. I haven’t done this in years as I’m continually improving myself. But I do enjoy educating people on the inner workings of the HPD psyche.) And depending on what other PD traits she has packed in her “suitcase” this is when the real fun begins. As they say… “The show must continue”.

Now, are you asking if a HPD woman will settle down and be faithful and happy with one man? The answer is no, especially if she is not aware/treated for it. Strangely enough I just read last night that out of all the cluster B disorders the histrionics have the most number of divorces. As for me, 2 marriages and 2 divorces under my belt and I’m always the one to leave. 🙈

      Is histrionic (high functioning type) personality disorder a lot harder to recognize by a partner than borderline personality disorder (high functioning type) and narcissistic personality disorder (covert type)?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      The key to recognizing a histrionic partner is to move beyond one-on-one settings and bring that person to several group settings with your friends and non friends and then observe what happens. As long as you just interact with the histrionic on a one-on-one basis her acting out strategies will not be apparent. You can think you are getting to know the one-on-one person but what you will see in social and or business settings will set the red flags waving.

What you will see is need to dominate the conversation, be the center of attention, entertain, even when they know nothing about the subject, suggestions that they should be involved front and center in projects they know nothing about but signal that they do, suggestions that they have close relationships with useful contacts, flirtatious behavior, undermining of same sex colleagues, sharing personal stories with strangers in the room beyond anything anyone else is sharing, long personal stories that you have never heard before containing manipulation of facts concerning their personal history, previous partner seduction stories masked and rewritten in their favor, redepictions of previous impulsive/reckless sexually oriented adventures, references to being sexually appreciated at a young age and appreciation expressed for that appreciation.

Depending on who is there it takes only a few social meetings for this dynamic to be clearly seen. It will be a startling experience that will make your one-on-one head spin. Who the hell is that person you will ask yourself. You will want your partner to please shut up and be normal.

What you cannot see is the degree of psycho manipulation involved in everything they are doing including in the relationship with you. A histrionic partner is never really present with you but instead working a greener pastures scheme in the background at all times. As if that wasn't fucxed-up enough, simultaneously they will pursue serious partner demonization schemes, hiding their splitting for as long as possible. They want you demonized as rationale for their upcoming “Alter” behavior. The degree of manipulative scheming going on is far beyond the imagination of any normal partner.

Never becoming attached enables them to inflict serious psychological damage (you care/they don't) without any remorse. Once they spilt they will depict not caring as the winning strategy.

Once you know the code, the histrionic is the easiest personality disorder to see visually in everyday settings operating in plain sight. The histrionic (extrovert) is proud of their sexually tinged approach to life and believes it is a rather special formula for success. They see no illness there. These are folks capable of serious relationship and partner destruction for no reason other than the acting out of their mental illness.

      What are some red flags early on in a relationship that a woman has histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Well for starters, that I’m even in a relationship! LOL! I FlIrt! I want attention from every hot man in the room. In college I was all about one night stands. (Yes, protection was used. I was easy not stupid.) In my mid 20’s I adapted my look because I no longer wanted one night stands but simple, raw, pure 100% focus on me when I was out. The thrill of taking guys home had worn itself out. I became the epitome of femininity. No more low cut tops and skin tight clothes. A soft, innocent, girl next door look drew a different kind of man. A new and different type of attention. I get bored easily so I have to switch it up and create a new game for myself. The damsel in distress it was and every guy felt like Hercules when with me, but no body got to go home with me so my desire factor increased. Being able to wield that kind of power is intoxicating and my own personal drug I crave. Not all Histrionics dress like tramps. It’s solely about the attention!!! and for each one of us we figure out what gets us that.
      I can’t stress this enough…. It’s all about the flirting! And talking about sex. And putting on a loud, dramatic “performance”. But it always begins and ends with me flirting. I even flirt with women but not in a sexual way Per se, but in a way that makes me popular with everyone. I stroke their ego to begin with and dish out tons of compliments and attention so people feel special…then the tables turn and it’s all about me and nobody minds. They actually excuse all my “friendly” behavior because I'm the nicest person! ( I mini love bomb people)
      It depends on each person but with me, you won’t see any traditional red flags 🚩 right in the beginning of a relationship. If I agree to be in one then I’m fully engaged in the love bombing stage and that man is all I’m focused on. (Although if you’re aware of what love bombing is… then theres your red flag) However, several months into the relationship the flirting will start back up. I become social again and meeting up with my friends. I’ll be low key about the flirting for awhile and not do it in front of him because I still like my boyfriend but it will pick up in intensity and frequency as the months go by and then I will do it in front of him. The dynamic has changed and I’m bored of the kind of attention he gives me. Then the drama about the shitty things my boyfriend is doing to me start. (Devalue) and before I know it I’m back to being myself and not caring about him….. Flirty, fun, dramatic, loud and manipulative!
      Side note…Since becoming self aware, getting on meds and doing therapy the loud, dramatic, emotional theatrics of this PD have calmed significantly so I’m not immediately recognized as a histrionic.
