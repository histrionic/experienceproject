<p><b><i>
      If my girlfriend suffers histrionic personality disorder and keeps lying about cheating on me is my best bet to ask the other guy she cheated on me with what all happen between them?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   You’re never going to get the truth.

Sorry. I should have given you a heads-up before ripping off that particular bandage…

Hey, man! How’s it going? I understand you have some questions about your histrionic wife’s fidelity and whether or not you’ll ever be able to trust her again. Well, I’m afraid I have some bad news for you, and you might want to have a seat before you hear it…

See above for details…

If you’re lucky, you’ll get a highly edited version of the truth, carefully scripted to make her look as sympathetic as possible. If you confront the guy (or guys, or women, or maybe farm animals… This is not a place of judgement) and he tells you the objective truth, why would you believe his version of the story over the subjective “truth” of the woman you have been loyal to?

I get it. You want closure. You want to believe that your entire relationship wasn’t just a lie. You want to believe that there’s some good left in the woman who snuck around behind your back.

Trust me on this one: Relationships can survive cheating, but it takes a lot of hard work and commitment. She has to show you that she’s willing to jump through whatever hoops you put in place to re-establish trust, and if she keeps lying when you want to know what happended, I doubt she has the integrity or the desire to rebuild that trust.

Every second you attempt to “work things out” with a histrionic woman that isn’t fully committed to working things out with you, you put your sanity, your freedom, and quite possibly your very life in danger.

Your only safe bet is to assume that everything she says is a lie and everything she does carries an ulterior motive. It doesn’t matter who she once was. Judge her on who she is.

She is a liar. Whether or not the personality disorder is fully controlling her life or not, she is a liar.

      Do you think the majority of histrionics cheat on their partners?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   Yes! Unless they have some awareness about their issues most of them cheat. Sometimes they will cheat after getting help.

Cheating though is diverse. Not all histrionics cheat by having sex…it could be flirting or chatting online… anything for some attention.One reason they might not cheat fully on you, that is have another secret relationship or have sex is if you live in a small community and she could be easily exposed. She fears that, especially if she gets her supply by being known as a good woman, rightious and nobel lol. Then she will think a lot more before doing anything. They are what is commonly known as a "Facebook Cheater". Another important aspect is that most histrionics are very paranoid. They may think people are plotting against them and so cheating with another man is risky behaviour.

One thing for sure, is if they don’t cheat fully on you, it is not because they are moral. Most of them would love to be having sex with a lot of the other men they see. It is just too risky. They play if safe by cheating in ways they hide and easily lie about.

    <p><b><i>
      Do all histrionics cheat on their partners when involved in a serious relationship, and how can you know when it’s happening?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   It depends on your definition about cheating. Physical cheating? Not all of them. Emotional cheating. Hmmm….more likely yes. Virtual cheating? Yes.

How do you know? Well, a lot of histrionics strive to be smarter than others and they know how to cover their tracks well. The smart ones usually use email to communicate. So if a guy or a girl prefer to communicate with emails, well, theres usually something fishy there. I mean, who uses emails for frequent personal use these days? The reason they prefer emails is that because they can reply at their convenience. It's also a bit more difficult to track than SMS or WhatsApp. If they use WhatsApp to communicate with you, they usually have more than one phones or a secret number.

If you are the one being cheated on, they will lose interest and be more cold and emotionally detached towards you. That's because they're investing their energy and attention on someone else.

The biggest give away is they will turn into someone else. Histrionics are like chameleons. They mirror their object of interest. Once they find a new “host" to latch on, they'll become that person. This is because they lack self identity, so they will adopt the new object of interest identity as their own. You'll see them developing new interest or behaving in ways that's completely different. If they usually listen to the 70s music, all of a sudden theyll listen to Billie Eillish. Lol. They mannerism will change and so will their way of speaking or accent. Theyll spell the eird “organise" with “z" instead of “s" because their new object of interest is American or they suddenly use a lot of medical terms because their new interest is a nurse. That sort of thing.

    <p><b><i>
      Why will my histrionic wife cheat on me if I stay loyal to her?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   Cheaters don’t cheat because of anything their partner does or doesn’t do. Whether a person has a personality disorder or not they cheat because of a deficit within themselves. Decent people don’t lie to lovers. If they are decent, they break up and then they date others, or they ask for an open relationship in which both people can have other lovers. There are no exceptions. When cheaters tell themselves that the reason is their partner, they are lying to themselves as much as lying to others. Personality disorders can be very difficult to live with but they are not an excuse to cheat.  

<hr class="line1"> 
      
      
      <p><b><i>
      Do people with Histrionic personality disorder lack Emotional empathy?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   Short answer: yes. Now, does this mean we don't feel it at all? No. Much like our other emotions, we just don't feel empathy as deeply as most other people, or it may really just depend on the situation (I feel bad when I see someone in pain).

It's a complicated topic, really, not a black and white one. It comes down to egocentricity. We are so preoccupied with meeting our own personal needs (i.e. need for attention, validation) that we don't stop to consider how our actions might affect others, how what we do makes others feel. We don't think about others’ needs even though we are great at faking it.

We sometimes can't understand and share other people’s feelings because we're too busy being “all up in” our own feelings. We're self-centered. What others go through simply isn't as important to us as what we go through.

It took me a while to stop kidding myself and realize that I am selfish, and I'm not as empathic as I once thought.

Of course, empathy “levels” vary from person to person, including non-disordered people.

    <p><b><i>
      Is it possible to feel secure after your partner with histrionic personality disorder has cheated?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   The best way to answer this is to first just consider beging cheated on. Then see how the dynamics change when the cheater suffers from hpd. As someone who has been cheated on my answer is no. How could I ever feel secure with the person that cheated on me.

Let's put this in the proper perspective. The physical act of cheating is not all that has happened.

Cheating begins long before the actual act happens. One decides that they will allow themselves to be viewed as someone who is not satisfied with what they have. They portray themselves as single. They put themselves in situations that cheating may become doable.

So cheating is premeditated. Each of us very well know the boundaries of our relationships. We know what's acceptable and what isnt. And we know when we cross them.

Therefore many things are lost as a result of the cheating. Sadly most times those things can not be recovered. Even if the other party is willing to try. It just simply will never be the same. And how could it be.

There are certain things that simply can not be made right and be redeemed in any way. Trust, security, faith in that person, the cheaters integrity, respect, honor are a few of those things that can not be gotten back after someone cheats.

Even understanding that people are human and they make mistakes can not help how a person feels who has been cheated on. It's hard to recover from. No matter which side your on.
      
      Oh, now throw traits of hpd in the mix. Well, those people are low and can’t love the proper way, they look for attention anywhere they can get it. They are always on social media or starring at their phone. Anytime you ask questions they turn it on you start yelling or crying right away. Then come the lies. They will never tell you the whole truth when it comes to  cheating. You need to leave. Once a cheater always a cheater always applies with them. Everything you think is true and ten times worse. There are good people out there and all cheaters (especially ones suffering from a personality disorder) feed off making you feel like you need them when in reality you don’t at all. Their minds are sick, they can’t love and never will. Do yourself a favor before you're too old and find a nice partner:

      What are the differences between a histrionic person and a narcissistic person?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   Very similar, but some differences. A histrionic (more females than male) personality is narcissistic, however they are sexually pervasive in every way! They blatantly ( not covertly) are very seductive and must command attention in every situation. She works hard and diligently to have a good body at any cost. A histrionic may dress and speak inappropriately in any given place and risk embarrassing their parter or even themselves. While everyone is whispering how ridiculous and slutty she looks or is acting, she will think everyone is admiring her and all women are just jealous of her. She may have ridiculous large augmented breasts, her clothing is suggestive and revealing her curves and her makeup and overall appearance is that of a Hollywood star. She purposely flirts with everyone and attempts to converse on a higher level that she’s actually capable of. She cannot stand to be ignored or not worshipped. She will surround herself with people she feels superior to and will shy away from those she may feel threatened by that are smarter, prettier or more popular, although in most cases she feels she possesses all of those accolades. She has no patience and wants immediate recognition and responses. She will cry and throw temper tantrums when she doesn’t get her way and manipulate with sexual innuendos and actions to get what she wants. She is jealous and can’t deal with not winning….meaning she has to always be the center of attention even with an ex. She will not stand for him to move on and be happy. She will sabbatoge and will compromise her own romantic relationship and anyone else’s to achieve the attention of men even if she doesn’t really want him. She is a jezebel. She will not feel guilty for breaking up a couple or her own relationship. She doesn’t even (want to) see it! She is shallow, has a false sense of knowledge and actually is insecure. She talks about herself, her achievements and typically does not genuinely inquire about anyone else’s. She doesn’t have a moral compass and boundaries don’t exist in her world. She like a narc will only think of herself, but will portray a false behavior of a “do gooder”. Men can be histrionic in very similar ways.

A narcissist male or female is a person void of empathy. They must always have a supply to make them feel important. The supply is usually one or two. Unlike a histrionic a narc focuses on one or two supply subjects at a time. The narc love bombs his subject supply until they are hooked. He confuses his supply with actions of adoration, but then pulls back and acts disinterested, forcing his supply to do anything to get the love and interest back. 

The narc surrounds himself with only powerful and important people. He socializes only with these and won’t lower himself to relationships with those with less status levels. He seeks positions of power and popularity. He likes to be publicly noticed but not in a sexual perverse way like a histrionic. He will study and research all avenues to keep up with the Jones’s, but at the same time feeding off his supply for the control high. He is insecure, but will never show it. He will say he’s committed but he never was and never will be to anyone. He will cheat and feel justified because he wasn’t committed in his heart or head. He lies constantly and with great ease. When he’s tired of the present supply he moves on to the next. He’s devalued present supply and will NEVER be sorry or take responsibility for his actions. He just moves on in the same circle. He is not capable of love towards others or himself. He only loves attention because it temporarily fills a void of the love and attention he didn’t receive somewhere in his past.

      What are some of the major differences between the borderline and histrionic personality disorders?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   Oh dear, I don’t know. Cluster B disorders are all similar. Borderlines are after love…believe it or not, Narcissists are after Admiration, Histronics are after attention, if they don’t get it then they don’t exist psychologically, it makes them feel ashamed and abandoned inside.

So the major difference is that, they need constant attention, usually sexual, their self-esteem and psychological survival depends on it.

The difference to the borderline is that hey don’t need constant attention but do need to provide distraction via denial, addiction, sex, intellectualisation, fantasy thinking, disassociation etc away from there internal emptiness and deadness of their anger towards their parents. They make chaos happen in front of them so they don’t have to look inside.

They both need to look away, or more aptly feel away from the real issues they just use different means of doing this.

Both of these disorders can have people acting in or acting out, meaning that they take there self-disgust, self-loathing and self hatred out on other people and/or themselves.

They could be lovable or horrible, or both.

The histronic will almost certainly be larger than life while the borderline could appear in countless forms.

Hope this helps, for a real lowdown ask a clinical psychologist who specializes in PDs, or someone who has been married to one for 10+ years.

      Can a person with hpd live a normal life?</b>
      <br>
<br>
    Absolutely! If fact, their incredible social skills and desire to people please usually makes them find fulfillment professionally. Their Achilles heel LIES in the relationship department. Without treatment and self-awareness they struggle to have the skillset to deal with their feelings. As a result they will continue using maladaptive behaviors that are intolerable in interpersonal relationships with others, romantically and otherwise. The key is for them to find a way to improve and manage their emotional reactions and expectations. This is not easy, but it is achievable with enough self-discipline.</i>

      What causes Histrionic Personality Disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   I think HPD's genetic aspects might be accounted for in the genetics of attractiveness..and then the nurture aspect of learning the attention seeking behavior from your unstable yet attractive hot mom - perhaps. Appearance is genetic, so can HPD be, but the behavior is learned.

Sometimes HPD can be caused by not being valued as a child and you fight for attention. Or, the dysfunctional liuving style or circumstances of the family of the HPD leaves them ignored and they become "entertainers" in thome to get any scraps of attention. The parents my be out of touch until the dramatic HPD rises their behavior to the unavoidable level...then they get noticed and recognized. Narcissistic parents can egg-on the Histrionic because they may have some tallent or looks that the narcissist parent can attribute to themelves (looks, singing voice, acting skills, impersonations), but it is usually an early learned behavior that get them positive attention from a parent. Often you will see mother-daughter duos that act like sisters as the Histrionic mother tries to act young and relate her beauty to her daughter's beauty. HPD mothers with HPD daughters may share boyfriends even and have poor skills in dating in their own age (cougars). They are not to be outdown by their daughters. Generally, they will hang out with lesser attractive females to amplify their beauty.

It may have roots in tragedy, loss and trauma too. If a young girl loses a parent, or is raped or some trauma has happened, the adult relatives around her may not know what to say to the bereaved child, so instea dof saying "I'm sorry that you lost you parent" to a 7 year old, they might instead fumble the words "You are just the most prettiest thing ever" in efforts to distract them and engage them on a superficial level instead of reminding them of the loss or truama. The HPD child assumes this one identity "I am pretty and this is how I stand apart and get noticed." This early abandonment through the loss of a parent makes them both BPD and HPD and the only difference is the outward versus inward manifestation and feeling a sense of atttractiveness that will never fail to get them attention.

Histrionic literally means "actor" as in a dramatic stage play. They learn to be the lead role in a dramativc life but often get a pass due to their beauty unlike the Borderline that has lower self-confidence. Both disorders are rooted in attachment deficits and idenity deficits and are very similar and both occur in females mostly. Flambouyantly gay males might meet the criteria for HPD and BPD as well.<hr class="line1">
    
    <p><b><i>
      What is a histrionic personality?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   The diagnostic criteria as outlined in the DSM5 is available for you to view at anytime via Google so I won’t repeat them.

Someone with HPD has an addiction to attention. It validates their low self-esteem and sense of worth. Their internal voice is “If they pay me attention, I am valuable”. They often behave in erratic or manic ways to obtain this attention. Diagnosis rates are low as it doesn’t seem to impact their functioning unless symptoms are severe. They typically lack emotional depth; ironically often their overblown emotional displays are an attempt to hide this. They move on from emotional events quickly.

HPDs cannot be satisfied with one person’s attention. It is boring and will not sustain their interest, so they appeal to the masses. They shape shift their personalities based on who they are with and tend to talk in a superficial way which matches the views of the group they are in at the time. Despite their overt grandiosity, they typically lack assertiveness and play out of the role of victim or princess to manipulate and achieve their outcome. They are highly adept at reading others; their impressionistic speech and actions change based on whose attention they wish to gain.

HPDs can’t tolerate rejection as it causes a blow to their self-esteem.They often hone in one person, mirroring them, until they reciprocate interest. Once reciprocation is there it’s usually game over; they move on to the next person or keep you as part of their ‘fan club’. They reject the partners they claim to want, but come back forcefully if they attempt to move on without them. In the words of one HPD “I want to know that he is lost without me and thinks about me all the time. Even if I break up with him I still want him to love me and think I am better than anyone he’s ever met. I don’t even care about him really. I always pretend I do though.”.

Often HPDs are not rejected unless the person is aware they are being manipulated and watch the misalignment between their self-proclaimed values and their actual actions. Therapists are trained to observe that these individuals act in a highly seductive manner that is specific to YOU. They quickly size you up in terms of your political values, goals for life, hobbies and interests and mirror them back to you. It can be flaunted, but is usually quite subtle. If you watch them across contexts and time though, they have no consistent values. Given their proclivity to lack empathy, this can make them do some pretty horrific things. They are recognised in the literature as being attractive and chronic infidels. Qualitatively, I don’t think this is true as I have seen HPDs with varying levels of attractiveness, but I do believe they are well made up and certainly make the best of what they have. Pair that with extroversion and it’s not difficult to see why people would rate them as attractive. It is not uncommon for their ex partners to say “I didn’t even find her attractive when I met her.”, but then developed feelings of attraction. Partners usually tend to have extremely high levels of empathy themselves which they project on the the HPD. Non empathetic types and the average individual tend to not stay attracted to the Histrionic as they will both expect to be put first in the relationship. HPD relationships usually settle into one way partnerships quite quickly; the HPD demands and sulks and the other self-blames and sacrifices. At one stage, the most recognised type of partnership in couples therapy were between Histrionics and Obsessive Compulsives.<hr class="line1">

      What does it feel like to be in a relationship with someone with histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   You will suffer from emotional burnout.
You will feel utterly confused and like you're going crazy.
You will be extremely cautious of what you say to them because of their hypersensitivity to criticism. Their self worth is so low they have no buffer to filter criticism.
If they are family you have no escape from this destructive interaction unless you're able to extracte yourself. If they happen to be your spouse you chose stay in the relationship probably because you lacked the clarity of what you're trapped in. Maybe you are extremely empathic and tried your best love and patience. Regardless, you probably became co-dependant over time. In the same way a battered wife stays with her abuser.
They seek unending validation and approval because they have an underdeveloped sense of self worth. The key is to realise that their appetite for feedback is insatiable. If you tell them their demand for affirmation is extreme they will attack you by calling you unloving, controlling and mean.
Very often they are high functioning individuals who are tireless and work hard. Being attention hungry they will work hard in their careers and friendships so their good qualities are admired and recognised. They adore anyone who shows them approval.
Benign neglect is the best approach. Don't try to correct their lies or exaggerations because they will escalate the story because they want the attention. The accuracy of the story is irrelevant because it is merely the vehicle to gaining sympathy.
I have been married to a wife who registers high as histrionic for 30 years and so the above is speaking from experience. Her ability to make me feel guilty about my role played a part in me staying in the relationship. It does not matter how nice, supportive or loving you are. You cannot fix them or help them. They cannot help themselves. Unless they get help and self-wareness you will lose every battle.

      What kind of partners do histrionic women like to date?</b>
      <br>
<br>
    Of all the personality disordered individuals the histrionic is the most skilled at getting their hooks in an all around good person. Most of them are boy crazy and cannot even talk to a guy without being flirty before they even reach adulthood. They will be quick to date any decent looking guy they see as fun and exciting, but staying with a guy is a challenge. They want a guy who is a gentleman to them at all times. Someone who will drop whatever he is doing to tend their selfish needs. A guy who is quick to forgive and forget all of their lying and cheating. He needs to be at her beck and call and keep giving her attention. He cannot judge her and let her do whatever she wants and accept she's always right. He must have a healthy sexual appetite and be ready to give her lots of steamy attention. A guy that will give her the benefit of the doubt any time she is in the wrong. It becomes only a matter of time until the guy, who she sees as an uninformed and innocent simp becomes her puppet and starts losing his mind. He feels sucked empty because he keeps giving and she keeps taking. Women with histrionic personality disorder disorder are more dangerous than women with narcissistic personality disorder because they are better actors and people pleasers. Unlike standalone narcs, they are capable of feeling some empathy. This makes them more convincing and even more lovable. It’s easier for a guy to eventually leave a borderline because “she’s nuts”. It’s easier for them to leave a narcissist because “she’s a bitch”. With a histrionic the guy is scratching his head and thinking “she didn’t mean to hurt me. It was an accident like she said. I know because look how sweet and caring she is with everyone”. Then after two years of dating the guy finds out that she was out partying and daiting different guys every time he was away from her. If they can get extra attention by dating or marrying a certain guy it is even better. Most people with histrionic personality disorder who get married or stay with a SO for any duration have some feelings of love towards their partner. But it is a different kind of love. A love without respect or morals. Eventually even the strongest guy or weakness guy will get pushed to the limit. That is usually when the histrionic partner has an awakening that something might be wrong with them. So, what kind of partners do histrionic women like to date? The guy that GIVES.</p>

      Do all people with histrionic personality lack empathy?</b>
      <br>
<br>
     People with histrionic personality are very capable of showing care and concern for other people, as long as the situation isn't related to themselves. It is even common for these people to demonstrate more empathy than the people around them when looking at situations they were not directly (or negatively) involved with. This happens all the time when they are at work or around people they only see on a superficial level. Then these same people will seem like they are completely lacking empathy to those who they are in a close relationship them. This is because their constant attention-seeking behavior makes it extremely difficult for them to see the bigger picture in a relationship. Unless they become self aware they will find it almost impossible to see someone else's viewpoint with any negative issues that are directly related to their behavior.

 <hr class="line1">
    
    <p><b><i>
      Do people with histrionic personality have a high self-esteem?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      No. Although people with hpd may appear to have high self-esteem this idea is incorrect. The loud dress and clothing, exaggerated speech and other attention seeking behaviors look like complete confidence. On the contrary, their self-esteem and self-worth is often based on how others view them and not how they view themselves. A person with histrionic personality will frequently rely on praise or interests of others to build up self-worth. Because of this, they may get influenced by outside suggestions.</i>

      Is it common for a person with histrionic or borderline personality to have multiple active romantic partners at the same time?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Is it common for someone with BPD to have multiple active romantic partners at the same time?

Yes this is a very common trait among BDP sufferers for a few different reasons.

Bored: After a while after all of the romantic endorphins have worn off they will become bored of you. The thrill they seek is the chase and NOT the capture. They want you because they can’t have you but once they have you you are seen as boring and predictable. If you keep the chase going by not responding to them, not reassuring that you love them constantly, setting boundaries and not falling for their every whim then they will be after you like a fly on rice.
The Void: Histrionics and Borderlines will do anything to try to fill the endless black void that lingers inside of them. They will loose the ability to feel anything and will try anything to feel again and that can result in multiple affairs, sexting, drugs, cutting etc.
Black and White Thinking: Non-disordered people understand that people are complex creatures made up of good and bad qualities and we are able to understand that if someone has done something to make us upset it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are a bad person. They may have had a bad day but that doesn’t define who they are underneath. Borderlines and histrionics often lack the capacity to see people this way. You are either all good or all bad depending on what you are doing or how you are making them feel at any given moment. This can fluctuate day to day or hour by hour. Once you are seen as bad all of your good qualities are lost in their minds. They will cheat to make you pay for your wrong doings and how badly you have made them feel.
Fear of Abandonment: This you will not be able to wrap your head around but they will cheat because they are afraid that you will leave them. They may feel some tension in your relationship and will automatically jump to the conclusion that you are ready to cut ties with them. Cheating then becomes their self-fulfilling prophecy and when you find out and their true fears are realized confirming their internal belief that everyone leaves them in the end.
Testing Limits/ Love: They want to see how much you REALLY love them. Will you accept cheating, yelling, excessive spending, threats, false promises? They are testing you constantly to see how much they can get away with before you will leave them for good. The longer you stay the more they will push your boundaries. This is NOT love its addiction and obsession.

The big issue that I see is that in many cases (not all), a person with hpd will tell their truth. Not the complete truth or even straight truth for that matter.

I believe that it all depends on stress levels going on inside of that person on what you might see. I personally was lied to for many years. That being said she didn't lie about everything.

I was constantly confused with all of the lies and gaslighting. But looking back on it, most things were not very true.

Throughout my marriage I was led to believe that I was the sensitive one. Nope that was just my nervous system in high gear from ptsd.

      Why do a lot of perverted men gravitate towards women who have borderline and/or histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Your question has more to do with the pwBPD/HPD than these men.

Those with BPD and HPD tend to be rather impulsive sexually. They’re likely to get themselves into situations or behave in a way that attracts these men or women. One thing you’ll hear from people that have dated a pwBPD/HPD is how sexual the pwBPD/HPD was so fast in the relationship. The lack of boundaries in a pwBPD/HPD also makes them much more likely to talk about inappropriate topics with complete strangers (including perverts). Many people with BPD and HPD tend to dress provocatively as a way to gain external attention and validation as well.

      What is it like to feel no core identity? What mental disorders have this as a central symptom?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Histrionic Personality Disorder

It is most often associated with dramatic, sexual, provocative behaviours but the underlying cause and feelings are overlooked and misinterpreted.

The reason histrionics have such dramatic and theatrical behaviour, is that they have no core identity.

This picture represents how a histrionic may feel and act. The girl literally becomes her environment, she becomes what surrounds her or what people mirror back to her. She encompasses it.

For histrionics, having no core identity can be severely scary, but we soften over it with theatrical displays and manipulative behaviour. We become what surrounds us, and mirror those that we talk to or interact with, so that we ‘become them’. We are not ourselves, we are whomever we are with. If they are gone, then we are not here, as we were them. They are us.

The most horrific situation for a histrionic, is to be completely and utterly alone. Having no one to mirror, or watch us is hell, as we feel like we are not really here. No one sees us so how could we even be here? So we act out, we become manipulative and scheming and dramatic and whatever you need us to be to get the attention and assurance that we need to feel real, to feel alive, to feel like we are someone.

I think Histrionics get somewhat of a bad reputation as being these girls (or guys) that are overly dramatic, play the victim all the time and act sexually, but the underlying cause can be sometimes extremely sad. It can arise from extreme neglect and abuse in childhood. Think about it, a child so neglected or abused the only way that he or she gets attention, she figures out, is to act sexually, act provocatively, act overly emotional. No child should have to do this to get the attention and love that she so deserves.

So if you feel this is you, feed yourself. Be dramatic, be theatrical, wear that outfit, put on a that makeup. You deserve it, you need it. No one who is not histrionic would understand. They have their needs, we have ours, ours may be slightly different and they may not understand it, but we do what we have to do survive.

Don’t hate us. All we want is what we never got.

      Is the freshmen girl who is flirty, attention seeking, and promiscuous with senior boys in high school likely a sufferer from histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Yes, maybe the quiet type aka high functioning. These girls are usually successful with academics, sports, etc. but have a history of sexual abuse. They think they are defective so they use a lot of boys giving them attention or affection as validation that they are still worthy.

      Do all HPD people cheat on their partners or there might be exceptions?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      I will not say all… but most probably yes!

They are people pleasers. They would do many things (immoral) just to please someone… get in good graces, to be liked.

I believe (my personal opinion) that any HPD can be manipulated to cheat! If they come across a person who understands their disorder and knows how to push the right buttons - they will submit!

In any case, not healthy to live with someone that you would never know if they are sucking co*k on the side.

PS. If you ask pwHPD if they cheat - answer will be definitely no. What a surprise. But reading lots of posts from ppl that fell victim to them… very easy to see pattern. And come to certain conclusion.

      Are girls who start showing early signs of borderline and/or histrionic personality disorder commonly targeted for sexual abuse/harassment?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Speaking from personal experience (and sadly, also my ex’s, and a couple of other ladies), there are certainly a number of factors which leave women with BPD/HPD at higher risk than average for being targeted for repeated sexual abuse/harassment. Excluding early childhood abuse which may have caused the personality disorder to develop in the first place —

BORDERLINE

Have trouble setting and enforcing personal boundaries, as well as respecting others’. Chronic people pleasers. Often social, friendly, flirtacious, approachable, quick to smile. Difficulty saying no.
Prone to retraumatization, seeking to be in and control relationships, which they associate with their childhoods but had no control, drawn to abusive partners, who also don’t respect others’ boundaries. Confuses sexual attention with emotional/romantic intimacy.
Dissociation is common under stress — sex may trigger dissociation. Dissociation may result in a total blackout period where the pwBPD has no awareness or recollection of what’s going on. There are even cases of dissociation causing uncharacteristic promiscuous behavior — during which the woman uncharacteristically flirts with inappropriate partners and consents to sexual acts they wouldn’t have in another state. This is actually a form of self-defense triggered by emotional conflict. She will not remember or understand later on. (Also sadly something I witnessed more than once with my ex.)
Less likely to be believed by authorities or loved ones if they report a sex crime — this may also be their personal perception based on past experience, which will lead to them not reporting the crime. May have been deemed untrustworthy or manipulative in the past. The girl who cried wolf. She represses the trauma, avoiding feelings of shame and guilt, believing that she is at fault and deserves what happened to her. This reinforces her core belief that she is worthless and unlovable.
Black-and-white thinking patterns cause them to see their abusers as “all good” or “all bad.” Meaning an abuser can manipulate his target into seeing him as “all good” again, invalidating her emotions of being taken advantage of, causing her to forgive his abusive behavior, and permit it to happen again.
Impairment or intoxication. BPD is associated with high levels of substance abuse. Someone who is impaired will be more vulnerable and likely to be targeted.
HISTRIONIC

Attention-seeking appearance, overly sexualized attire and presentation, craves attention and wants to be noticed. This will often get her the wrong kind of attention, but it’s what she’s used to, so she’ll normalize it.
She will be accused of “asking for it” or “wanting it.” No one will believe her when she says it was rape.
Overlaps with BPD in the areas of impulsivity/risky decision-making, substance abuse, increasing vulnerability.
The grim reality is that many women with BPD/HPD will have sexual experiences which they feel ambiguous about, because they aren’t able to identify whether or not they consented to it or whether or not the attention was even desired. They may think they’re interested at one point, craving affection or attention, then change their minds because the man wants to do something they aren’t comfortable with, and be unable to say no until it’s too late. Because they didn’t say no, they’ll rewrite the incident in their minds as something that was irresponsible and risky, but desired. This alleviates the need to blame someone outside herself. The man will argue that she was consenting and willing, because she didn’t say no or fight back.

Women who display this kind of behavior are more likely to be blamed or shamed than validated and understood. This is the fear that keeps women from coming forward to blame their abuser. It’s important to always be gentle and believe any woman who is reporting a sex crime.

      Why do people with histrionic personality disorder need excessive attention?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Excessive need for attention is common in most Cluster B disorders; Histrionic Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. The exception being Antisocial Personality Disorder. The reason in BPD and NPD is a subconscious need for validation. It’s the same for HPD. They need to know they exist, that they matter, they’re important, they’re needed or wanted (this is particularly true with seductive or sexual attention seeking), someone is thinking about them, or they’re being talked about. Hence why you see “dramatic” behaviors in these personality disorders as well. They don’t typically care if the attention is negative or positive, obviously positive is preferred but sometimes attention is attention, period.

      What is something that almost nobody knows about histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Histrionic is usually visible in plain sight, unlike BorderlinePD, but they can get away with a lot because it appears in many contexts to be just extroverted "confidence".

For partners it might take a while for other background symptoms other then sexualized showing off to become visible. By the time the partner figures it out is it often too late.

Like BPD partners, histrionic partners will fake attachment to partners and depart at the drop of a hat to pursue greener pastures regardless of relationship duration or history.

They would think nothing of departing without any explanation if the time seems right to them. They tend to be working a scheme in the background that they intend the partner not to become aware of.

When you look back, you will recall glimpses of behaviors that were sociopathic. Histrionics in a sense are gaming their partners basically, so they can be quite hurtful or dangerous.

      What are the chances of my marriage surviving? My wife has histrionic personality disorder (HPD).</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Unless you can put up with a lot of double standards, emotionally draining drama, hot/cold, push/pull and none of your needs/desires being important, then your chances are pretty much next to nothing. And the reality of it… you don’t deserve that kind of treatment and you should definitely get a divorce and find a healthy relationship after you do some therapy yourself to no longer be attracted to women like your wife. I’m sorry, I’m guessing that’s not what you wanted to hear. If it helps realize the problem is not with you. It is with her. It might feel like a curse, but it is actually pretty impressive that you were able to marry her in the first place. She found something unique and amazing about you. Most women who are histrionic struggle staying with the same partner at around the six month mark. And that's if the guy doesn't leave after getting fed up with her flirting with other men every opportunity she gets. She might not have figured out her obsession with getting noticed by other men, but she knew keeping you was also a priority. It is like a person who has a favorite food or their home. They might be willing try other things. They might even decided they enjoy them, but nothing beats the pleasure they get when eating their favorite dish. Likewise, vacations and roadtrips can be exciting temporarily, but nothing feels safer and better than being home. You feel like a rock that's been thrown around. Still, you are her rock! Good luck with whatever decision you make!

      Can people with histrionic personality disorder be loyal and feel real love?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      When I was not self aware and not doing therapy and on medication…. No chance in hell. Sorry about your luck! Today is a different story. Currently, I haven’t found a man yet, since my divorce years ago, that I want to stay in a relationship with long enough to commit long term too, and that I’d be willing to work through the low points that would lead me to wander. However, after much work I’m reaching that point where I do feel it will be possible when I’m in the right relationship. At this point in time, Instead of hurting the guy by staying and lying that I love him and/or then cheating, I end the relationship. That’s major growth for me right there.

      What should a guy expect when a girl with histrionic personality disorder dumps him suddenly for another guy?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      The next guy is just a source of approval, like you were. HPD’s are mostly incapable of forming close bonds with others and rarely differentiate the importance of one individual to another. If it suits her purpose to call you abusive, she will. It is highly likely this will be the case as this will garner her lots of attention from the next guy.

Withdrawing attention will take a huge blow to her fragile sense of self, probably more than they can handle. She will likely cycle around again to see whether she has a hold over you; if she doesnt, the shape shifting to the person of your dreams starts again. She wants to know you will always be an attention source for her, and will create any persona to attain this from you. Dont be fooled, she will express a strong point of view to you in the morning and the total opposite to the other person she meets that evening. kind of scary to say the least. Who you think she is and who she is will likely be different. Look for lack of consistency in thoughts, actions, behaviour, moral values.

They do not crave deep and intimate relationships, they crave the feelings of infatuation from partners that result in great amounts of attention for them. Your thoughts, needs or feelings rarely show up on their radar. If she comes back and you want your place back, remember your role; deliver attention, approve and indulge her over exaggerated stories and drama. And remember that whatever you do, you cant give enough attention. No one gives as much as someone in the honeymoon phase, so they seek it out over and over again. That is why some partners are able to have a successful relationship with them for any duration before shit hits the fan. They are able to spend lots of time with them. She is able to keep her attention bucket filled by her committed man. The only problem is the bucket has to stay getting filled because it has a hole in the bottom. As soon as the guy gets a different job or something else disrups all of their together time she starts looking for other sources to fill it.

<p><b><i>
      Is a woman with histrionic personality disorder likely to commit violent acts when angry or to express harmless dramatic emotions?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      They like to pair with a person with hidden self-esteem issues that will put up with a lot of push-pull in order to keep his trophy partner. Histrionic is the only disorder tied to physical appearance; they can be attractive or socially confident (confidence is attractive). But they mostly only have to threaten that a relationship is over and the partner will cave in. Sometimes the guy is simply a doormat. Other times it's a good guy waiting for the person he fell in love with to return. 

Violence is sure to occur over one thing though: jealousy. Histrionics cannot abide by being rejected. They are the most important thing and of highest value - they can’t imagine being the one that gets dumped - they dump people, and often, not the other way around. Except for rejection and jealousy, they are not typically violent. They have far better ways to destroy a person and their fragile self worth. They chose a partner who they feel is willing to take on the identity of “I’m her man.” It is enough for them because she will convince him that he is defined by being with her and it gives him status. She is eye candy. He is no one. Actually, all of the friends of the Histrionic are like this too. They are fan clubs and hangers-on.

<p><b><i>
      Do people with histrionic personality disorder use the gaslighting technique to manipulate their partners?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Short answer would be YES! Histrionics most often have one or more (sociopathic-like) schemes running in the background which you are not supposed to notice so gaslighting is a way to deflect attention away from those schemes. Rather like having a partner with two personalities, one lightness and one darkness, the one you are looking at socially everyday lightness with an extroverted smile on her face is only half of what is going on there.

Seeking control and your sole attention the darkness persona is hacking into your cellphone at night (boundary violations typical) when you are sleeping to monitor your activities without ever revealing. The next day she creates lots of drama that has nothing to do with your phone suggesting you are deficient in some way. While you are present in good faith this is what she has her mind on, never revealing any of it to you until the big bang break.

Often they are on the hunt for departure rationale as they simultaneously hunt for better partner options…Somewhat ironically this is what she assumes you are doing. Those two hunting activities are always ongoing continuously….the hunt for demonization fuel and the hunt for better options.

Never really getting attached and faking intimacy, you are just a temporary meal ticket until better options can be found. As soon as they are found all of the hidden investigation of you comes out in the form of demonization as they head out the door, often without a word of explanation, with the relationship house burning to the ground. All positive history is forgotten as it means nothing to them. A nice added gaslighting touch might be accusing you of being incapable of intimacy. Most of what they tell you is upside down.

You having no closure at all is no problem for them as by then they have constructed a rationale that you really deserve whats coming to you. This makes sense to no one except the histrionic who spends a lot of time in her own scheming head rather than being present with you.

Very easy for normal partners to become disoriented in this continuous crazy-making context. Welcome to the histrionics world…very similar in many ways to the BorderlinePD partner experience except that the histrionic partner is much more extroverted and confident that their sexualized approach is the key to success in the world.

These are exhausting and psychologically dangerous folks. All time invested in them is wasted as they are unstable, highly manipulative, impulse driven and never satisfied. No amount of attention can fix this as it is a childhood injury.

      What are the common behaviors of a person with histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Histrionic personality disorder is one of the ten disorders on the personality spectrum in the DSM V.

HPD is a mental health disorder that affects thinking, perceiving and relating to others. It is chronic and may last for years or for a life time. It’s treatable but prognosis may be poor or guarded, and is not curable.

It is one of cluster “B: personality disorders or “dramatic” disorders with attention seeking at its core, intense unstable emotions, and a distorted self image with an excessive need for approval, including inappropriate sexualizing, erotic, manipulative, demanding and erratic behavior. They can also be very charming. They use a form of dress to bring attention to themselves. Etiology is unknown though it is presently thought to be caused by biological, cognitive, developmental and social factors. They are found to have defective neurotransmitter release systems and a malfunction in a group of neurotransmitters called catecholamines. They may disassociate, claiming 2 or more personalities in severe cases and use displacement of anger, shallow and shifting emotions in less severe cases. When the speak, they aim to please and to impress. As you may surmise, diagnosis is complicated because symptoms mimic other disorders. It may take several structured and unstructured interviews before a diagnosis is made. The MMPI -2 and projective drawings may be useful. There is high correlation of co-morbidity with alcoholism, somataform, conversion, and major depressive disorders. It’s fairly easy to mistake for borderline personality disorder, however, less suicidal ideation or attempts mark HPD from BPD.

Long term treatment is indicated, especially psychodynamic therapy. group therapy and cognitive behavior therapy may compliment efforts to decrease dramatization. repression, and other behaviors associate with the illness. They really are the drama queens of the world but the disorder is not limited to females.

      Is a woman with histrionic personality disorder likely to commit violent acts when angry or to express harmless dramatic emotions?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      I am not one for violent acts. I don’t start physical fights or destroy property because the response to that is not the kind of attention I thrive off of. Nobody will take your side, or emotionally support you if you’re damaging people/things. Example… when the news reports of violence no one feels sorry for the people doing the destruction to property, they feel awful and want to help the victim. If I’m angry I’m going to manipulate the situation by getting the other person to feel bad about whatever they are doing to me (even if I deserve it). For example, if I’m angry with my SO I’m going to cry, which automatically weakens him…. no man wants to see a woman cry, they are fixers and the gut reaction is to make it all better. Then I’ll emotionally twist the situation and tell him how much I’m hurt and whatever other emotion I’ve discovered, in the time of being with him, that I know will hit him the hardest to make him buckle to my will. Afterwards, I can then go and get more attention from friends by sharing what my SO did to me and how he apologized, (which shows he was wrong not me 😈) and now I have their support that his character is questionable so down the road, when I inevitably leave, everyone agrees I should have and I deserve so much better.

So no, violence is not my thing. I like emotional drama.

disclaimer…. I have been on meds and in therapy for 13 years and rarely do these kinds of actions anymore. I have healthy coping mechanisms and communication skills and am just a better person all around.

      What is the definition and characteristics of Histrionic personality disorder and is it similar to borderline personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Hi! My name’s Vanessa, and I’m here to tell you about an exciting new product from PDs ‘R Us! This five-minute nymphomercial will give you everything you need to know about acquiring your very own Histrionic Adaptation! Doctors and therapists agree, it’s a bitch to treat, but a pleasure to try!

Are you a person with BPD, grappling with existential fears of a lonely and meaningless existence? Do you constantly find yourself engulfed and reliant on a single romantic partner to give you the love and validation you need to hold your emotions together every day? If so, don’t worry. We at PDs ‘R Us have developed a revolutionary adaptation that will give you the validation and attention you crave, without the hassle of human attachment!
<br>
Histrionics is a fast-acting formula that can calm even the worst meltdown in minutes, simply by finding a stranger to cover you with the admiration and praise that you so desperately ̶n̶e̶e̶d̶ ̶ deserve. For best results, adhere to the following ten-step procedure:

Breathe. Remind yourself that you’re a sexy goddess who could get anyone you want, if you wanted to. But you don’t want to. You don’t want to commit like that. Because commitment requires vulnerability, and vulnerability risks pain. Pain is weakness. Weakness is just… so dissatisfying. Who needs a romantic partner who could abandon you at any moment, when you can get love and attention from anyone on the street!
Put together your sexiest outfit. Show some skin. Apply the world’s sexiest makeup; emphasize your best traits. Pick a shade of lipstick that will stand out in a crowd. Create a mask that advertises to the world, “I’m open for anything, and out of your league.”
Realize that you can flirt with anyone. Young, old, gay, straight, blind, ugly, religious… Doesn’t matter who, doesn’t matter where — the tenets of flirting are the same: Be open. Show interest. Smile. Make eye contact. Give him a blowjob with your eyes from across the room. You’re not talking to their conscious mind, you’re reaching deep into their animal brain and flipping the switch that says, “YES!” Laugh at their jokes. Welcome their compliments and positive gestures. Encourage them to listen, but don’t ask them questions. Questions give them the power over the conversation, and the power is in your hands. Keep it. Even if they’re hardwired to not want you, sexually — those poor, deprived straight girls — they’ll still be thrilled to give you attention of some variety.
Talk yourself up. Modesty is an instrument of the modest, and no one pays attention to the modest. Cut that shit out. You’re not a temp at The Gap, you’re a senior sales associate for a major distribution centre. You’re not a student, you’re an aspiring professor in transcultural, comparative literature. You’re not working on a book, you’re weighing offers of publication for your premier, genre-breaking novel. You’re not just someone from the suburbs, you’re an heiress to your father’s flourishing real estate empire, used to exquisitely expensive treatment. You’re not just a girl, you’re a princess, queen, and empress, deserving of unadulterated adoration and generosity. You’re not in a relationship, you’re newly single and looking to party. Because, psst! Here’s a secret! As long as you never form attachments with people, you can tell them absolutely anything, and it becomes true, if only for a night. No repercussions, aside from a complete lack of intimacy and a general reliance on external validation to give you a sense of identity. But who needs those things when you’re drowning in gifts and adoration??
Don’t chase, and don’t work for attention. That gives them the power, too. If someone doesn’t want to give you attention, just avoid that person. You don’t need that kind of negativity in your life.
Speaking of negativity, remember that hatred and resentment is attention. Hate and love occupy the same place in the brain, so if someone refuses to give you adoration, go ahead and seduce their boyfriend. Instant attention. Two birds, one attention-seeking missile.
Realize that all attention is good attention. It doesn’t matter if an action is embarrassing, because no one can look away. It’s okay to make a scene if they don’t have your preferred brand of luxury bottled water. It’s okay to dance naked in front of a bunch of strangers because someone dared you to. It’s okay! Guaranteed attention. Allow strangers to goad you, and they’ll praise your open-mindedness. Or your wildness. Or your curves. Praise is praise, right?
Let that pesky sense of identity evaporate in the heat of others’ expectations. Owning your own identity means getting hurt if others judge you for it. We don’t like weakness, remember? It’s so much easier — and feels so much better — to just be who people want you to be, do what they want you to do, and never have to worry about showing them who you really are. Put that in a box and forget about it (until the inevitable mid-life therapy, of course).
Be open to anything, but never put out. Never reject anyone, and never say no to a proposition — just deflect it down the road. The appearance of not having boundaries will fascinate anyone, as they’ll think they finally found someone as crazy as they are. Their hope in a future will nail them to you like a cross. Hope is your friend. Hope is your wingman. Hope gets you into private parties, puts a drink in your hand, twirls you around the dance floor, and pays for your Uber home. Hope treats you to exotic meals in far away places. Hope buys you flowers, texts you sweet nothings before bed. But when you start having sex, the pressure starts. They want exclusivity. And it’s hard to keep up a detached charade when you’re seeing the same stranger over and over again. Eventually, he might not be a stranger anymore, and when that happens, hope will crumble and you’re right back where you started. Don’t have sex. At all. Period. Unless you really like the guy, in which case, ride that dick like an electric bull, you fabulous she-tiger!
Always keep at least three strangers on the hook, in case the stranger you’ve been seeing gets too close. As any IT professional will tell you, always have a backup. Protects against sudden crashes and viruses.
Women who have switched to histrionics have reported a ten times higher rate of compliments than women who stick to quiet, self-harming adaptations, and are more than fifty times as likely to have pop songs written about them. Those choosing histrionics have also reported a significant boost to their sense of confidence and control, although histrionics may also be associated with an increased risk of harassment and discrimination in the workplace.

Side effects may include shortness of temper, increased sense of grandiosity, weight loss, accusations of infidelity, infidelity, inflated feelings of self-importance, alcoholism, premature workplace termination, living a college lifestyle in your 30s, disappointment from friends and family, reduced trust, regret, and a ‘reputation’.

Ask your therapist if a histrionic adaptation is right for you. Don’t delay, since your friends, family, and partner can all abandon you at any moment. But wait! There’s more! If you upvote in the next 24 hours, you’ll receive a sense of complicit satisfaction absolutely free! Call now to join the thousands of men and women who’ve decided to give up a sense of identity in exchange for unearned adoration. You’ll be happy you did.

      Do women who suffer from histrionic personality disorder and flirt really bad with other men when their partner is away know they are flirting, or in their mind do they just think they are being kind and friendly?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      People with histrionic personality disorder (HBD) only think in terms of attention and admiration so their thinking driven by only these two things

How can they get attention of all people around them?
How can they look better in the eyes of other people?
Now let me address these two things one by one

How they get attention?

People with HPD gets attention by showing extreme emotions. If they get attention easily that's best for them but sometimes they want too much attention for that they exhibit extreme emotions like yelling in public , crying in public loudly, laughing all of sudden in loud voice on things which aren't even funny, walking in sexual provocative way in public and in some cases start stripping in public (they will have a proper reason to justify this).
How they make themselves better in the eyes of others?

Once they will get attention now they will show themselves like really humble and down to earth person and they do this in a subtle way.

And these above two points go together hand in hand

For example let say a girl named Suhani with HPD is in a restaurant. She is sitting on her seat and person just passes by her seat so she will start yelling on that person for some unknown reason (known to her tho). She will yell on this person till everyone start staring her(attention part done).

Now to show herself better in the eyes of other people she will kiss him(on cheeks if she is in relationship)/hug him all of sudden in front of everyone and say oh thankyou I didn't notice in your perspective I really consider Your perspective.(admiration part)

Now comes to your question

it depends on what she wanted in that situation attention or admiration

If she is trying to get attention by flirting then she won't be sure or you can say she doesn't know surely is that she wanted

But if she is trying to get admiration by flirting then she does know what she is doing but she justify her actions by making assumptions in her mind like the one you mentioned to feel being kind and friendly to others.

Thanks for reading ❤️

      Do people with histrionic personality disorder enjoy seeing other people suffer?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      I do not believe that people diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) are intentionally or plotting to hurt others.

They lack self-esteem, suffer from anxiety, and more often than not have a diagnosis of depression.

They are often self-centered and they are constantly seeking attention whether that is in a positive or negative way.

They are seeking love and often do it through seduction and many especially in their young years look for it in a much older person.

They may equate sex with love or think sex can come before love rather than the opposite, so they are emotionally unfulfilled and often they keep seeking out partners who may sexually satisfy them but leave them feeling empty and broken.

They have great difficulty keeping friends and as they get older they often have problems in their professional lives where they quit their job over some perceived slight or they are fired due to their inappropriate behaviour.

A person with (HPD) has little insight into their issues so they have can have a very difficult time understanding what they have done wrong in certain situations.

If you have been hurt by someone with (HPD) or if you have been diagnosed with (HPD) I hope this information is helpful.

      Is someone with histrionic personality disorder just as manipulative and deceptive as someone with narcissistic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      HPD and NPD are two separate disorders although both under the same Cluster B category. Comparing them is like comparing an orange and a tangerine. Same different.

Some people refer to HPD as NPD with sexual flavour. I can see where they are coming from as some of the HPD's symptoms mimic exhibitionist/overt narcissist, but there are distinct differences between them.

PwHPD crave attention just like pwNPD, but pwNPD care about their image and building reputation. PwHPD care more about positive attention but negative attention will do sometimes. Everything about them is loud and can border being inappropriate, from the way they dressed, talk and behave. Even if they are being seen as sluts, they won't care. Some may actually be proud to be viewed that way. PwHPD require not only attention but also praise, admiration and validation that they're good/smart/good looking, etc.

PwHPD are much more moody and emotional to the point of dramatic, that they are easily confused with pwBPD. PwNPD are by far slower with their emotions.

Unlike pwNPD who tend to be dry, vold, detached and mechanically seek to pleasure themselves in bed, pwHPD tend to be very hot and seek to pleasure their sexual partner first in bed. They also tend to romanticise a relationship as more intimate than it is. Any flirtation or sexual advantage will be seen as love by them. Not so with pwNPD.

Do pwHPD manipulate others like pwNPD? Yes, if they need too, for different reasons and in different ways than pwNPD.

      Do histrionic women ever settle down with one partner?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Yes, they will settle down with one partner…. For awhile. Then they get emotionally bored. Because the poor guy can't live up to their expectations. He must be able to make over them 24/7 and drop whatever he is doing for her no matter what. If he can't he's failing. For me, that’s around the six month mark. I’ve already been devaluing/idealizing you for some time but that magic six months seems to be when the mask really begins slip, and I don’t mind it. Now the relationship gets twisted and the real emotional mind fuckery happens and I’m just getting back into my element. Enter Drama Queen Supreme. (Yes, I know, I’m a sick person. I haven’t done this in years as I’m continually improving myself. But I do enjoy educating people on the inner workings of the HPD psyche.) And depending on what other PD traits she has packed in her “suitcase” this is when the real fun begins. As they say… “The show must continue”.

Now, are you asking if a HPD woman will settle down and be faithful and happy with one man? The answer is no, especially if she is not aware/treated for it. Strangely enough I just read last night that out of all the cluster B disorders the histrionics have the most number of divorces. As for me, 2 marriages and 2 divorces under my belt and I’m always the one to leave. 🙈

      Is histrionic (high functioning type) personality disorder a lot harder to recognize by a partner than borderline personality disorder (high functioning type) and narcissistic personality disorder (covert type)?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      The key to recognizing a histrionic partner is to move beyond one-on-one settings and bring that person to several group settings with your friends and non friends and then observe what happens. As long as you just interact with the histrionic on a one-on-one basis her acting out strategies will not be apparent. You can think you are getting to know the one-on-one person but what you will see in social and or business settings will set the red flags waving.

What you will see is need to dominate the conversation, be the center of attention, entertain, even when they know nothing about the subject, suggestions that they should be involved front and center in projects they know nothing about but signal that they do, suggestions that they have close relationships with useful contacts, flirtatious behavior, undermining of same sex colleagues, sharing personal stories with strangers in the room beyond anything anyone else is sharing, long personal stories that you have never heard before containing manipulation of facts concerning their personal history, previous partner seduction stories masked and rewritten in their favor, redepictions of previous impulsive/reckless sexually oriented adventures, references to being sexually appreciated at a young age and appreciation expressed for that appreciation.

Depending on who is there it takes only a few social meetings for this dynamic to be clearly seen. It will be a startling experience that will make your one-on-one head spin. Who the hell is that person you will ask yourself. You will want your partner to please shut up and be normal.

What you cannot see is the degree of psycho manipulation involved in everything they are doing including in the relationship with you. A histrionic partner is never really present with you but instead working a greener pastures scheme in the background at all times. As if that wasn't fucxed-up enough, simultaneously they will pursue serious partner demonization schemes, hiding their splitting for as long as possible. They want you demonized as rationale for their upcoming “Alter” behavior. The degree of manipulative scheming going on is far beyond the imagination of any normal partner.

Never becoming attached enables them to inflict serious psychological damage (you care/they don't) without any remorse. Once they spilt they will depict not caring as the winning strategy.

Once you know the code, the histrionic is the easiest personality disorder to see visually in everyday settings operating in plain sight. The histrionic (extrovert) is proud of their sexually tinged approach to life and believes it is a rather special formula for success. They see no illness there. These are folks capable of serious relationship and partner destruction for no reason other than the acting out of their mental illness.

      What are some red flags early on in a relationship that a woman has histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
      Well for starters, that I’m even in a relationship! LOL! I FlIrt! I want attention from every hot man in the room. In college I was all about one night stands. (Yes, protection was used. I was easy not stupid.) In my mid 20’s I adapted my look because I no longer wanted one night stands but simple, raw, pure 100% focus on me when I was out. The thrill of taking guys home had worn itself out. I became the epitome of femininity. No more low cut tops and skin tight clothes. A soft, innocent, girl next door look drew a different kind of man. A new and different type of attention. I get bored easily so I have to switch it up and create a new game for myself. The damsel in distress it was and every guy felt like Hercules when with me, but no body got to go home with me so my desire factor increased. Being able to wield that kind of power is intoxicating and my own personal drug I crave. Not all Histrionics dress like tramps. It’s solely about the attention!!! and for each one of us we figure out what gets us that.
      I can’t stress this enough…. It’s all about the flirting! And talking about sex. And putting on a loud, dramatic “performance”. But it always begins and ends with me flirting. I even flirt with women but not in a sexual way Per se, but in a way that makes me popular with everyone. I stroke their ego to begin with and dish out tons of compliments and attention so people feel special…then the tables turn and it’s all about me and nobody minds. They actually excuse all my “friendly” behavior because I'm the nicest person! ( I mini love bomb people)
      It depends on each person but with me, you won’t see any traditional red flags 🚩 right in the beginning of a relationship. If I agree to be in one then I’m fully engaged in the love bombing stage and that man is all I’m focused on. (Although if you’re aware of what love bombing is… then theres your red flag) However, several months into the relationship the flirting will start back up. I become social again and meeting up with my friends. I’ll be low key about the flirting for awhile and not do it in front of him because I still like my boyfriend but it will pick up in intensity and frequency as the months go by and then I will do it in front of him. The dynamic has changed and I’m bored of the kind of attention he gives me. Then the drama about the shitty things my boyfriend is doing to me start. (Devalue) and before I know it I’m back to being myself and not caring about him….. Flirty, fun, dramatic, loud and manipulative!
      Side note…Since becoming self aware, getting on meds and doing therapy the loud, dramatic, emotional theatrics of this PD have calmed significantly so I’m not immediately recognized as a histrionic.

      Should a guy who is in a relationship with a woman who has histrionic personality disorder be offended and take it personal when she flirts with other men, or should he realize it is a part of her disorder that she cannot help?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   It’s not part of her disorder she has the choice to do what she wants so she could choose not to and should not or else she isn’t ment for a good relationship with trust because let’s face it no trust it’s just a waste of time

          <br>
<br>
  As with all Cluster Bs its so simple…Just ask her point blank a yes or no question…Are you cheating? Yes or no…not a conversation starter its one or the other..if she acts destroyed then you know..anger? You know..yes or no
Pay close attention to facts and story line. Most of the time they will no make sense. A person that lies will always make mistakes. Sorry you are in this position.<hr class="line1">

  You are suggesting the presence of a layer of morality which is absent. Histrionics, often extroverts, believe they have a winning scheme and they are hell bent on sticking to it. They will, as part of splitting, subvert your own moral code and eventually depict you as the moral demon. Clearly they deserve better. They are constantly on the greener grass prowl. Highly competitive, thats the upside down world of histrionics. Its a shxtstorm. Don't get stuck in there.<hr class="line1">

  <b>#</b>What is wrong with my fiancé? Does she have histrionic personality disorder? I just found out that for two years she’s pretended to be single just long enough for guys to call, message or ask her out. Then she tells them she’s taken. She said she likes the though of all guys wanting her.</b><br><br>
  
   
  While I could probably write a book on what’s wrong with such people who are so empty inside and seek validation by hordes of other people to fill a void that can never be filled, that’s not going to help you. The TL;DR version is that she has myriad issues that she needs to address herself as no amount of love you give her or money you spend on her, or anything you do will ever be enough.

My most compassionate suggestion for you is to tell her that she needs intensive therapy, find your own place if you live together, and bid her farewell and go no contact. None. At all. No exceptions. People who have an addiction for attention suck the life force out of you, and you may not have even noticed how drained you feel as it was a gradual process.

Block her everywhere, resist the urge to have sympathy for her, and see a therapist yourself. If you didn’t see the signs before, you will likely be hyper-vigilant now and may possibly end up with trust issues that could affect your future relationships. She betrayed you for two years and lied to who knows how many others—-that’s pretty crappy choices and behavior. But under no circumstances should you give her any more of your time, money, or love. You didn’t cause her issues and you can’t fix them. Save yourself now.
  <br>
  <br>
  <hr class="line1"> 
  
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">Your fiancé is emotionally immature, troubled, and cruel. All of which is common with histrionic and narcissism. She has an unhealthy need for attention and loves playing mean games with other human beings. This addiction to male validation is not going to go away once you’re married, so I hope you will rethink your engagement and your relationship. Not only is she addicted to attention, she must be also excited by the possibility of enraging dudes she has led on. I’m sure that many of them have been understandably very angry with her, and if she’s turned on by that, she really poisonous.

She needs professional help to undo this addiction and to examine her narcissistic, cruel behavior. Think of all the time and energy she has dedicated to this cat-and-mouse game during the two years you have been together. Is this a person you really want to be with? She has no character.
  </p><br>
  <br>
  <hr class="line1"> 
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">I think she might have an attention-seeking problem. There is a normal level of attention seeking - showing off the new car on social media, telling your friends about your mean coworker, wearing flattering and fashionable clothes to a casual outing, etc - and then there’s not a normal level (histrionic personality). Maybe she wasn’t given enough attention as a child, maybe she developed the habit as a teen and hasn’t the courage to let go, however it might have developed, she might need some help breaking the habit. Have a talk with her, maybe consider taking her to see a counselor to work through it, but just be honest and calm with her, and I think it should be okay.
  </p><br>
  <br>
  <hr class="line1"> 
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">She’s self-absorbed, manipulative and is possibly shopping for a “better deal.” She enjoys the attention and she’s using her confidence and security in your relationship to string others along.

My recommendation is that you break this off immediately. You can and will do better. Her behavior won’t stop. Problems only magnify when you marry. It will hurt now, but the sooner you make the move, the sooner you will move onto better people.

I am sorry you had to go through this, but it’s better to learn this now than to make a huge costly mistake later.
  </p><br>
  <br>
  <hr class="line1"> 
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">She seeks the attention of other men to make her feel good, she probably feels inadequate so she seeks this to make her feel better about herself.

Have you had a serious conversation with her about this? She might need counseling or something to help her replace bad habits with good ones. This will only bring problems into the relationship. . She might be telling them she is taken, until one day when she decides to go for it. Her attitude is not a healthy one you might want to consider if you want to get caught up in her drama.
  </p><br>
  <br>
  <hr class="line1"> 
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">If am not wrong, yes, this is a woman with a mental condition, because she seems to enjoy playing with People's emotions without a care in the world.

Not even thinking of the repercussions of her actions both on herself, the person she's tagging alone and of course her 'husband or boyfriend’.

Word of advice, see evil, call it evil and run away from evil and have nothing to do with evil.

Another thing is that she should get help before things get ugly.
  </p><br>
  <br>
  <hr class="line1"> 
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">That is master manipulator and narsicist, which is related to histrionic behavior. Not only that, she is putting herself in danger. One day some guy might take serious offense to being tricked and seek revenge, or worse.

My first thought was to tell you to dump her, but what she's experiencing needs treatment and not abandonment. Believe it or not, this is an expression of self-doubt and low self-esteem. She needs your support, but also your boundaries!

Good luck!
  </p><br>
  <br>
  <hr class="line1"> 
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">Sounds like she is very insecure and with low self esteem. Both are common with hpd even though it doesn't seem like it. She seems to want to know that she is desired by men, gets the attention, and that satisfies her until she needs another man to message and ask her out.

She does not seem to value herself or know her worth, independent of the approval and pursuit of men. This is concerning, because it borders on infidelity.
  
  </p><br>
  <br>
  <hr class="line1"> 
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">She might need some therapy most likely a borderline narcissist.

    <b>#</b>What are the advantages and disadvantages of dating/marrying someone with histrionic personality disorder?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   First off, let me say congratulations! You’re clearly a very interesting guy if you were able to get a girl with HPD to want to marry you. Ms. Histrionic is a woman like any other, and she likely dreamt about her marriage from an early age. She longed for a prince charming, desired — more than anything — to find that other half of her soul. It seems she knew that person was you, and I have to assume you felt that person was your wife. So. You’re both entering into this arrangement from the same place.

The thing is, your wife doesn’t want to live life the way she’s currently living it. It’s not how she imagined her life would be. Without awareness she’s grappling with a persistent and devastating sense of emptiness on a daily basis that can only be filled by near-constant reminders that she is valued and admired. She has trouble — real, persistent trouble — filling her own void when you aren't around and making over her. She isn’t properly able to remind herself of her own identity and validity, and needs attention as a means of holding it all together. Without that, she will slowly feel like she’s losing herself; disintegrating; and before long, she’ll lose what made her her. You will feel like you don’t recognize her anymore, and neither will she. When this happens — when she nears rock bottom — she will look elsewhere for the attention and validation she craves. If you cannot meet her unrealistic needs, she will try to find someone who can.

Given that your wife has been cheating on and lying to you, it seems to me that she’s already been dealing with an empty void for a long time. Like it or not, the fact remains that her actions are partially — of course; she’s not a victim; but partially — your fault. It sucks to hear, but listen. It’s important.

When you first started dating, you showed her a side of yourself that she fell in love with. For her to marry you, you must have proved that you could and would meet her attention demands. You were probably very romantic, very attentive, very patient, nurturing and fun to be around…. so she wanted to tie the knot, thinking that this dynamic is what she could expect from you no matter what. Your romance and attention is a HUGE part of why she picked you in the first place. The problem is, life happens. Maybe you got different jobs your schedules changed once you got married. You got more responsibilities. YOU felt that you couldn't keep up the romance like when you first started dating. You got each other; you both committed. You still gave her lots of romance and attention but you couldn't maintain it the way she demands. You had to focus on other things like school, work, or your family, or whatever else. It’s natural. No one can blame you… but you need to understand that, by lessening the attentiveness place on your wife, you are letting her down - at least she thinks so. You are breaking an unspoken promise that she thought existed between you, that SHE would always be your top priority; that SHE would get all the attention that she needs from your loving arms. SHE should never have to wait for you to fill her. Not even a little bit. You have to be there to fill her. Fill her with compliments. With laughter. With love.   

So while you feel hurt and betrayed — and that’s totally 100% correct, given that she did in fact betray you — SHE feels like she is betrayed. She likely feels that you aren’t the man she dated or married. Yes, it's crazy. She may even be attempting a power play to try to remind you that being with her has a cost; that you need to keep paying in order for the relationship to work. There will never be a time when she will be okay receiving less attention from you than she than she did at the beginning. It’s even the opposite — as time goes on, she’ll expect MORE. The more she can’t get right away from you, she’ll get it from someone else. That’s the unspoken and twisted rule of HPD. If you didn’t know that before you got married, you’ve now learned it in a most painful way. Sorry for the rude awakening.

If you want your relationship to survive, you need to commit — REALLY commit — to giving your wife the same amount of romance and attention that you did when you were wooing her, at the very least. Tell yourself that the dating phase of the relationship never ends. Take her out at least twice a week; be prepared to spend every night of the week with her, showering her with love, giving her the pleasure of the bed that you’ve come to expect from her, and don’t plan on leaving her alone for more than two days in a row. If you can manage that, I guarantee that your marriage will work.However, if you cannot commit to that, if you can’t make yourself devoting that much of your energy to your relationship, then the best option is to leave her now. 

Histrionics live life by different rules. We need attention like we need food, and our appetite is insatiable. Gluttonous. If you can engage with us on our terms, you’ll get the most electrifying, dynamic, gorgeous, sensual partner around. But if you’re not willing to bend your rules for us, we just don’t see why we should bend our rules for you.<hr class="line1"> 
    
  <p style="font-size: 1.8em;">The advantage is that when it is just you and her, you will feel so valued and special. She will maintain a strong and enjoyable sexual relationship. The disadvantage is that if she can tell that you have fallen in love with her and want to always be with her, she will start to betray you, lie and cheat and you will struggle to even see it coming.

      Can a histrionic ever have a successful, loving relationship with a non-histrionic?</b><br>
<br>
     Not really. In my opinion a histrionic personsality disorder is basically the same thing as a narcissistic personality disorder and a cheater. I'm pretty familiar with those. Here we go. 
      Being with a person with npd is not really a relationship. Yeah you might hang out all the time.. go places.. have sex but that's not all there is in a true relationship. Firstly a relationship needs intimacy and they eventually have sex just to get off this is not really intimate. Real intimate sex is going to have a lot of I love you's and looking into each other's eyes and doing things to make your significant other happy.. and lots of cuddleing and sweet talk at the end. Nice playful kisses and holding hands. Narcissist don't really do that even when they feel happy. They will fake like they do. Second.. a relationship needs caring and being able to talk through difficult times. They don't like to do that either.. they'll either get irritable or ghost. Third.. a relationship needs commitment/trust. Narcissist like to live a double life.. one day be with you and act all fine.. the next be with there friend, family or another “supply” and talk bad about you. Fourth.. relationships need people to bond.. that's how you care for the other person and love them. Narcissist do not bond. They have very little empathy for your sadness.. depression..stress.. or pain. Those are just a few points why a relationship would not work with a person who has narcissistic personality disorder. How do you know a person has npd? 
      Narcissists have a binary all one way, or all the other way view of the world.
Consequently, significant others are either with them or against them……………
Additionally, they perceive their significant others as being either all good winners or all bad losers.
Narcissists have a grandiose false-self which enables them to, at times, assert that they are all knowing, all powerful, and omnipresent.
At other times, narcissists whose self-esteem is not regulated properly are apt to descend into a shame spiral and upon crash landing are known to experience morbid depressions..
Narcissists are hypersensitive and prone to experiencing narcissistic injuries due to real, misperceived, or imagined slights.
They devalue others harshly and callously.
They lack empathy: They can not genuinely put themselves in the emotional shoes of others.
They lack whole object relations: they can not see themselves or others as integrated people having both good and bad traits.
They lack object constancy: If they become angry with or are even just temporarily separated geographically from their significant others— out of sight equals out of mind and past history between them and their significant others is seemingly forgotten.
Narcissists like to live in “the now” without having to consider past wreckage they had precipitated. Additionally, they are impulsive and prone to not consider future consequences.
Narcissists do not self-reflect and engage introspection.
      Cheaters. I Think they are scum of the earth. Absolute bottom feeding, dishonest, lying, disgusting, selfish, Cowards.

Just in case I wasn’t clear enough though:

CHEATERS are The MOST WEAK, disloyal, disrespectful, desperate, immoral, self-centered, unfaithful, complete pieces of garbage that are lower than sidewalk spit. 
      
      Cheating on someone is one of the worst things you can do in a relationship, up there with domestic violence and child abuse. It’s an absolutely despicable act and regardless of how you try to look at, there’s no excuse for the cruel betrayal that occurs when you cheat on your partner.

People always try to justify their actions despite knowing it’s wrong because they want to convince themselves that they’re not wrong. A common one I hear is that their partner was not satisfying their needs and ignoring them, so since their partner doesn’t care for them, they have to look elsewhere.

Simply put, what in the hell is that mentality? In what world do two wrongs make a right? What benefit is there staying in a relationship if your partner doesn’t care for you? If you’re going somewhere else at least do the right thing and break up with / divorce the person, because while breaks up or divorces can be messy or hard, it is an infinitely more appropriate way to go about treating your partner (or ex I guess) right and maintaining dignity for yourself and them.

I understand in some situations it can be complicated because there are children involved, but the steps you should take then are to try every possible method to reconcile with your partner, and if that doesn’t work, children or no, there’s no point staying in a relationship where you’re not loved and you don’t love.

So to summarise, I have absolutely no respect for people who cheat on their partners. People make mistakes, yes, but you knew it was wrong and did it anyway and there’s a good chance it happened more than once. If you’re sincerely sorry, I don’t think you should be forgiven for your actions necessarily and should accept any consequences that come your way, but I’ll respect you more than someone who tries to justify their actions as a cheater
      <br>Most cheaters are essentially narcissist which have the constant need to feel wanted, desired, and put on a pedestal. One person can not do that no matter how hard you try. They even become disgusted if you continually try to make them feel loved. You will end up drained and completely lose your sense of self. They need the constant challenge of getting new victims. But will occasionally come back to you when he feels you slipping out of his control. No contact is the best revenge AND best thing for healing you.
