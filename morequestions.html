  <p><b><i>
      What are the odds a young lady with a histrionic personality disorder can date her high school sweetheart, marry him and have kids with him, yet flirt, seek attention/emotional affairs throughout the entire relationship but never physically cheat?</b><br>
<br>
     Highly improbable. The more you flirt the higher chances that she will reach the point of no return. And if she is pretty and attractive and enjoy sex then the chance for sex outside of marriage is likely to eventually happen and maybe even more than once.

Follow your gut instincts.

Find the truth by yourself.

But be ready what you might find will hurt!

A lot!</i>
