      Do people with Histrionic personality disorder lack Emotional empathy?</b>
      <br>
<br>
   Short answer: yes. Now, does this mean we don't feel it at all? No. Much like our other emotions, we just don't feel empathy as deeply as most other people, or it may really just depend on the situation (I feel bad when I see someone in pain).

It's a complicated topic, really, not a black and white one. It comes down to egocentricity. We are so preoccupied with meeting our own personal needs (i.e. need for attention, validation) that we don't stop to consider how our actions might affect others, how what we do makes others feel. We don't think about others’ needs even though we are great at faking it.

We sometimes can't understand and share other people’s feelings because we're too busy being “all up in” our own feelings. We're self-centered. What others go through simply isn't as important to us as what we go through.

It took me a while to stop kidding myself and realize that I am selfish, and I'm not as empathic as I once thought.

Of course, empathy “levels” vary from person to person, including non-disordered people.
