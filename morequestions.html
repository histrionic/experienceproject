     Is finding out my new girlfriend sees a psychologist for histrionic personality disorder something I should be concerned about? Why?</b><br>
<br>
   Yes, you should be concerned for a lot of reasons. Without knowing all the details of your relationship what I can tell you is limited and in general.

A lot of people would tell you to end the relationship immediately. I’m not going to tell you that because she is seeing a psychologist. That will make a world of difference. However, I would still proceed with caution. If you haven’t already you may start noticing dynamics in the relationship that get more annoying and don’t make much sense the longer you are in the relationship.

For instance, you may notice that she has serious expectations for you in certain situations, but doesn’t seem to think she needs to practice doing the same things. This could happen in a lot of ways, but you will likely notice it the most with how you interact with other women as opposed to how she interacts with other men.

She may tell you that she doesn’t like it when you talk to one of your female coworkers even if all interaction is all work-related. She may not even say it but you will just be able to tell she doesn’t like it. If you care about her you will automatically start changing your behaviors to appease her. Then you will arrive at her workplace to surprise her for lunch and you will see her talking to multiple men. This will eventually get old. Not just because she talks to men after telling you not to talk to other women. What will be aggravating is how she talks to these men. You will feel like the cute, sweet, and flirty demeanor that should only be shown towards you (her partner) is being extended to other men; men she knows or men she doesn’t know. It will seem hypocritical, and that’s because it is. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder usually live by a lot of double standards.

It will likely just come down to how much she does this and how much you put up with it. Hopefully, the therapy will keep a lot of her traits (bad habits) at bay. You still need to be ready to nip things in the bud right away. Explain to her what you are witnessing, how it feels, and why it feels that way. Be direct but stay calm. She will try to act oblivious or like it is no big deal and change the subject. It is important not to let her do this.

Make sure that she gives you her undivided attention (just like she expects from everyone else) with what you have to say. Make it clear that you will likely not want the relationship with her to continue if she keeps acting that way with other men. You can’t just tell her something bothers you. A woman with HPD will usually not be motivated to condone herself a particular way only because it makes her partner feel a certain way. If you do that she will just get good at acting a certain way when you are around or she’s expecting you to show up. She needs to know that being flirty with other men will likely lead to you breaking up. If she genuinely likes you she will at least try.

Something you should understand, if you’re not already beginning to figure it out, is that an HPD partner will always behave and think much differently than partners free of the disorder. This is because most people keep various things that they are motivated about evenly distributed. Whereas the main focus daily and above all else for a person with HPD is to be noticed and get attention, usually this is validation and approval. If they get stressed, lose awareness of what is going on, and think they are not getting the amount of attention that feels right, they will act impulsively. This is usually something they will likely regret later but not at the time due to being desperate. To avoid the consequences they will lie or act on impulse again to cover it up.

They may get better at managing their emotions through therapy and awareness. However, the will of their partner, friends, and loved ones is not enough to help them regulate their emotions or conduct.

When looking at the big picture people with HPD can be really good company. If they have an intervention to address their problematic issues it is possible to have a fun and loving relationship with this type of person. Just make sure that fun is kept in check and stays appropriate, aways and across settings. If this cannot be maintained then you should get out of the relationship before you commit and become attached. Otherwise, you will marry someone who can make a career out of having secret relationships on the side and keeping you in the dark about it. It could be emotional affairs, online affairs, or physical affairs. Regardless, it will be a relationship based on lies and manipulation. Being with a partner like that is a horrible way to live. Again, proceed with caution.

There are a lot of assumptions I could make, but you haven’t touched on everything AND she is in therapy. Therefore, we can give her the benefit of the doubt.

I will leave you with this. If you currently feel like she excessively flirts with other men while you are with her, and it is stressing you out, then you would blow a gasket if you saw how bad it is when you are not with her.

Good luck!<hr class="line1">

     If someone has strong traits of narcissistic personality disorder AND histrionic personality disorder AND borderline personality disorder, how do you tell which one is mostly driving the machine?<br>
  </b><br>
  It really does not matter…many overlaps…What does matter is that the “machine” has no empathy for partners and will run you over without a second thought. Histrionics and Narcissists are highly competitive, often scheming you so poor choice for a partner. They will not ever be emotionally attached to you like a normal human. If what you are describing is your partner go get yourself some professional mental health support asap. You are going to need it. You are in danger. Don't sign up for your own destruction.<hr class="line1">

     What are some red flags early on in a relationship that a woman has histrionic personality disorder?</b><br>
<br>
  Everything in people with Histrionic PD loudly scream “Look at me! Don't you notice me?”

They are attention seekers. You cannot miss the signs. Everything from the way they dressed, talk, carry themselves.and behave is meant to be noticed. Very often they appear inapptoriately flirtatious, sexually provocative and highly seductive. They don't care even if people think the worst of them as long as they are being noticed.

I know someone with Histrionic PD. On the surface she looks like a sex maniac but it's not really the sex she's after. She wants love and she associates sex with love. He father never once said “Iove you" and the only time she feels loved is when she has sex with someone.

Not everyone with HPD cheats although they are very much prone to cheating. My friend would have sex with any man but never had two sexual partners at the same time. Other pwHPD may cheat or have multiple sexual partners at once. She would shamelessly flirt and seduce men at any given time, even in a professional setting. She believes she's super and sexy , which to her means she’s lovable. Her biggest fear is to no longer be hot and sexy which means she will no longer be lovable as to her, when a man agrees to have sex with her, that means he loves her.<hr class="line1">

<br>
   Ummmm gimme a sec to think about this……..fuck yes. pwHistrionic disorder are most likely comorbid with a grab bag of other Cluster B goodies. So you're guaranteed a fun ride with this one. Sit back, relax, I'm talking about relax like Yoda because your going to need to, and watch as the royal grade fucking A shitshow unfolds; if it hasn't already. Prepare for Boundaries to blown off there foundation. Gaslighting, manipulations, straight up lies for days, and various other tried and true techniques to throw you way off center, confuse the fuck out of you and generally put you in survivor mode. Get ready for a PTSD diagnosis.

I pray to Baby Jesus you're not married w/ kids😬 Split, make like a baby and head out, or like a bakery truck and haul buns. Leave post haste forth with. You dig? Find a badass therapist, tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Get to the botttom of your past trauma's, find yourself. In fact I highly recommend you start a yoga practice🧘‍♂️

      If a woman who is in a relationship or married and suffers with histrionic personality disorder, is it impossible for her to resist the temptation to flirt and cheat with the other men around if her partner is away for any long duration?</b>
      </b><br>
<br>
   I would believe so. The need for attention and no self control would result in whatever behavior the compulsive self would need to do in order to obtain it's fix. It's just like any addiction. Lies and blame usually fall into the partner for the bad behavior. It's frustrating and draining for the partner when there is constant lack of trust and then projection and gaslighting to make the partner give in to the bad behavior and feel they in some sort of way caused the disordered partner to behave that way. It's really like being the partner of an adult toddler. They want attention good or bad and they will do whatever and say whatever to get it. Regardless if it causes hurt to someone they are supposed to care and be honest to.

      Is it common for women who suffer from histrionic personality disorder to be addicted to porn?<br></b>
<br>
   Yes, many forms of. Histrionics will be inclined to make their own. Dress up and play. Exhibitionist..Center of attention…Inclined towards sexual approach to everything. <hr class="line1">

      What happens when a guy who has been in a longtime and pretty successful relationship with a girl who has histrionic personality disorder all the sudden gets a new job and can’t see her every day like he has for two years?</b><br>
<br>
   Just focus on enjoying the time you get to spend together and keep yourselves busy when you're apart, same as any relationship where you have incompatible work schedules or live far away. Even if you're busy, a thoughtful good morning and good night text goes a long way. Always ask about your partner's day and how they're doing. Make plans for when you're together next time so you have something to look forward to. If she doesn't handle the time apart well and her HPD acts up, that's her responsibility to learn how to cope with her symptoms on her own, not yours.

     What is some of the saddest but best advice for someone who is in a relationship with a sufferer of histrionic personality disorder?</b><br>
<br>
   Best advice would be GET OUT. Saddest advise would be just be aware that the illness has no cure. It can be treated but they most often resist acknowledgment of their illness. They are convinced they have formulated the secret to success in the game of life. Manipulation of you, crashing the relationship house down, then disappearing without any explanation are actions without consequences, from their warped perspective. You want to see cruelty? Stick around.<hr class="line1">
      
         
        <p><b><i>
     Why is it that a lot of the behaviors that are associated with females who have histrionic personality disorder don’t fully manifest until they move out, away from mom and/or dad and get their own place and life?</b><br>
<br>
   Freedom is a double-edged sword.

There's no buffer zone given by the presence of the parents and siblings if any.

Parents also jus by their sheer presence can bring out stability and discipline in the person.

There's someone in the house to answer to … so late nights are curbed on its home..even if late nights happen the need to keep one's image intact…also factors in to less drinking and less wild behaviors.

Parents anchor the kids that's in every household… when alone ..some females may find freedom a way too much to handle and also unruly people find it easier to enter such females lives via common associations or common friends.

Also its easier for many to drink too much … get into drugs… create scenes…feel sorry for themselves…feel unwanted or unloved…office politics or politics in friend circles get too much …its easier for many to gang around a single person.

that's why smart parents don't let kids stay alone …many of the parents scout a suitable living option with relatives or close ppl near by or PG with a stable family.

     Should I leave my wife since she was diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder? For years she’s stressed me out with her constant flirting. I asked her to see a psychologist and she was diagnosed. Will she probably always secretly flirt/cheat?</b><br>
<br>
   only you know whether the bad times outweigh the good. the diagnoses should actually make you feel better in a way i would think, at least you know it’s a disorder and not anything lacking in you. you say the flirting stresses you out, which is understandable. but cheating would be a lot worse to me, i’m not sure if you mean you know for a fact she does that too. i guess it depends on whether she’s willing to stay in treatment and how much you are willing to put up with. she will probably always have the histrionic tendencies but it doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to stay married if you both work on it.

    Do women with histrionic personality disorder basically want every decent looking guy to be attracted to them or what? My girlfriend wants to get married. She just told me about her diagnosis. I want to understand it better. What am I up against?</b><br>
          
          
  <br>Histrionic Personality Disorder is actually fairly rare, less than 2% of the population, and is characterized by pervacive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior.

They tend to be dramatic and lively to draw attention to themselves and use their sexuality, openess and flirtation to charm people.

When they aren’t the center of attention they may do something dramatic such as creating a scene, lying or exagerating to get attention or sympathy, may limp when they aren’t hurt, etc.

This behavior often wears thin on those around them because their need to be the center of attention is constant and, it eventually comes across as self-centered. Relationships can feel very imbalanced.

So, that’s the main thing you are up against. On the one hand, people with HPD can be sexy and exciting. Never a dull moment with someone that dramatic. On the other hand, you may wake up one day, exhausted, and wonder “what about me?”<hr class="line1">
