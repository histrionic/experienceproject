     If someone has strong traits of narcissistic personality disorder AND histrionic personality disorder AND borderline personality disorder, how do you tell which one is mostly driving the machine?<br>
  </b><br>
  It really does not matter…many overlaps…What does matter is that the “machine” has no empathy for partners and will run you over without a second thought. Histrionics and Narcissists are highly competitive, often scheming you so poor choice for a partner. They will not ever be emotionally attached to you like a normal human. If what you are describing is your partner go get yourself some professional mental health support asap. You are going to need it. You are in danger. Don't sign up for your own destruction.<hr class="line1">

     What are some red flags early on in a relationship that a woman has histrionic personality disorder?</b><br>
<br>
  Everything in people with Histrionic PD loudly scream “Look at me! Don't you notice me?”

They are attention seekers. You cannot miss the signs. Everything from the way they dressed, talk, carry themselves.and behave is meant to be noticed. Very often they appear inapptoriately flirtatious, sexually provocative and highly seductive. They don't care even if people think the worst of them as long as they are being noticed.

I know someone with Histrionic PD. On the surface she looks like a sex maniac but it's not really the sex she's after. She wants love and she associates sex with love. He father never once said “Iove you" and the only time she feels loved is when she has sex with someone.

Not everyone with HPD cheats although they are very much prone to cheating. My friend would have sex with any man but never had two sexual partners at the same time. Other pwHPD may cheat or have multiple sexual partners at once. She would shamelessly flirt and seduce men at any given time, even in a professional setting. She believes she's super and sexy , which to her means she’s lovable. Her biggest fear is to no longer be hot and sexy which means she will no longer be lovable as to her, when a man agrees to have sex with her, that means he loves her.<hr class="line1">

      If a woman who is in a relationship or married and suffers with histrionic personality disorder, is it impossible for her to resist the temptation to flirt and cheat with the other men around if her partner is away for any long duration?</b>
      </b><br>
<br>
   I would believe so. The need for attention and no self control would result in whatever behavior the compulsive self would need to do in order to obtain it's fix. It's just like any addiction. Lies and blame usually fall into the partner for the bad behavior. It's frustrating and draining for the partner when there is constant lack of trust and then projection and gaslighting to make the partner give in to the bad behavior and feel they in some sort of way caused the disordered partner to behave that way. It's really like being the partner of an adult toddler. They want attention good or bad and they will do whatever and say whatever to get it. Regardless if it causes hurt to someone they are supposed to care and be honest to.

      Is it common for women who suffer from histrionic personality disorder to be addicted to porn?<br></b>

   Yes, many forms of. Histrionics will be inclined to make their own. Dress up and play. Exhibitionist..Center of attention…Inclined towards sexual approach to everything. <hr class="line1">

      What happens when a guy who has been in a longtime and pretty successful relationship with a girl who has histrionic personality disorder all the sudden gets a new job and can’t see her every day like he has for two years?</b><br>
<br>
   Just focus on enjoying the time you get to spend together and keep yourselves busy when you're apart, same as any relationship where you have incompatible work schedules or live far away. Even if you're busy, a thoughtful good morning and good night text goes a long way. Always ask about your partner's day and how they're doing. Make plans for when you're together next time so you have something to look forward to. If she doesn't handle the time apart well and her HPD acts up, that's her responsibility to learn how to cope with her symptoms on her own, not yours.

     What is some of the saddest but best advice for someone who is in a relationship with a sufferer of histrionic personality disorder?</b><br>
<br>
   Best advice would be GET OUT. Saddest advise would be just be aware that the illness has no cure. It can be treated but they most often resist acknowledgment of their illness. They are convinced they have formulated the secret to success in the game of life. Manipulation of you, crashing the relationship house down, then disappearing without any explanation are actions without consequences, from their warped perspective. You want to see cruelty? Stick around.<hr class="line1">

     Why is it that a lot of the behaviors that are associated with females who have histrionic personality disorder don’t fully manifest until they move out, away from mom and/or dad and get their own place and life?</b><br>
<br>
   Freedom is a double-edged sword.

There's no buffer zone given by the presence of the parents and siblings if any.

Parents also jus by their sheer presence can bring out stability and discipline in the person.

There's someone in the house to answer to … so late nights are curbed on its home..even if late nights happen the need to keep one's image intact…also factors in to less drinking and less wild behaviors.

Parents anchor the kids that's in every household… when alone ..some females may find freedom a way too much to handle and also unruly people find it easier to enter such females lives via common associations or common friends.

Also its easier for many to drink too much … get into drugs… create scenes…feel sorry for themselves…feel unwanted or unloved…office politics or politics in friend circles get too much …its easier for many to gang around a single person.

that's why smart parents don't let kids stay alone …many of the parents scout a suitable living option with relatives or close ppl near by or PG with a stable family.

     Should I leave my wife since she was diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder? For years she’s stressed me out with her constant flirting. I asked her to see a psychologist and she was diagnosed. Will she probably always secretly flirt/cheat?</b><br>
<br>
   only you know whether the bad times outweigh the good. the diagnoses should actually make you feel better in a way i would think, at least you know it’s a disorder and not anything lacking in you. you say the flirting stresses you out, which is understandable. but cheating would be a lot worse to me, i’m not sure if you mean you know for a fact she does that too. i guess it depends on whether she’s willing to stay in treatment and how much you are willing to put up with. she will probably always have the histrionic tendencies but it doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to stay married if you both work on it.

    Do women with histrionic personality disorder basically want every decent looking guy to be attracted to them or what? My girlfriend wants to get married. She just told me about her diagnosis. I want to understand it better. What am I up against?</b><br>
          
          
  Histrionic Personality Disorder is fairly rare, around 2% of the population, and is characterized by pervacive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior.

They tend to be dramatic and lively to draw attention to themselves and use their sexuality, openess and flirtation to charm people.

When they aren’t the center of attention they may do something dramatic such as creating a scene, lying or exagerating to get attention or sympathy, may limp when they aren’t hurt, etc.

This behavior often wears thin on those around them because their need to be the center of attention is constant and, it eventually comes across as self-centered. Relationships can feel very imbalanced.

So, that’s the main thing you are up against. On the one hand, people with HPD can be sexy and exciting. Never a dull moment with someone that dramatic. On the other hand, you may wake up one day, exhausted, and wonder “what about me?”<hr class="line1">
