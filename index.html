<h2>Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD)</h2>  
<h3>
Histrionic Personality Disorder is part of the <i>Cluster B</i> group of personality disorders. Cluster B disorders are also known as dramatic disorders. They are characterized by excessively emotional and unpredictable thoughts, behaviors and interactions. HPD, in particular, is characterized by the use of these behaviors to attract attention from others. People with the disorder purposefully use their appearance and actions to cause others to focus on them. This may include acting seductively or sexually, responding to social cues in an overly dramatic way, fabricating personal problems, taking criticism poorly or drawing attention only to themselves in group settings. They may also frequently change the way they act and look depending on who is around them. Distinctively, HPD is one of the only mental health disorders that directly impacts the appearance of an individual suffering including hairstyles, clothing choices and makeup. HPD creates serious problems in with the familial and romantic relationships of the sufferer as the affected individual acts out, often in ways that, for those close to them, are hurtful and difficult to understand.
